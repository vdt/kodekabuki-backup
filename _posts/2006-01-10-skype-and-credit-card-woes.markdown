<div><p>How pissed off would one be when he wanted to pay for something but someone else actually didn't accept it? Its a really bad situation that I would never want to be in if I were Skype. It is these simple things which can screw a software company. Almost 6 credit cards (including mine, my dad's and my mom's) were refused on Skype's website while I was trying to refill my account with more Skype credits. This is one thing which is enough for me to get switched over to Google Talk (if they get it right), once they launch their phone services.</p>
Meanwhile I'm back in Singapore, and using a new version of Flock. Looks like they're innovating once again - this time it's their Shelf feature. Really useful for bloggers! But once again not so difficult to imitate with an extension in Firefox :) Flockers, do something which would convince me that it can never be done graceful enough via extensions.
