Just read about this startup Yatra.in at <a href="http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=61527">Indian Express</a> online. Seriously, there's no better time to start an India-specific online travel site than now. Domestic airline market is growing like hell. Indian tourist traffic to neighbouring South East countries (esp., Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam) has been also growing substantially. And most importantly, more Indians than ever before can afford air tickets now!

If I were to start a web 2.0 company, this is the space I would look at right away! As it is, there aren't very big players right now. <a href="http://www.makemytrip.com">Makemytrip.com</a> and IndiaTimes.com's travel page seem to be the current leaders. The crucial factor lies in moving first and establishing yourself before other biggies enter the market or even if they do enter the market, you'll be atleast ripe enough for acquisition as part of Priceline.com's India-consolidation plans :)
