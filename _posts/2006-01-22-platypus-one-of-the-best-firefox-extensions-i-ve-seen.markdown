<div>Ever dreamed of an extension which lets you create Greasemonkey scripts the WYSIWYG way? I did and believe me it even exists - it's called Platypus, still in beta, but works like a charm! Go try it!

<a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org/">mozdev.org - platypus: index</a> 
 <blockquote>There are already around 10 platypus-configured userscripts in my Greasemonkey and that too within 10 minutes after installation. Though it works beautifully right now, the real test would be to see how long these scripts can stay useful considering that website designs might change. Ofcourse, there is nothing much Platypus can do about this but atleast it will be nice if Platypus can point to you immediately after the website design changed so that you don't miss anything important!
