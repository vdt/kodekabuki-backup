When I read that Yahoo! acquired <a href="http://www.webjay.org/">WebJay</a>, I was really pissed off. But at that time I didn't realise how productive WebJay can be. The funny thing about most music sites is they don't help you choose the right music - perfectly tailored to your taste. Ya I agree they track all your favorite songs, albums, bands and suggest some stuff to you, but it never works right. 

WebJay basically leverages on collective human cycles to solve the playlist problem. Everybody makes playlists and then shares them with others. The reason this rocks is there's always someone who has pretty much a taste like you or atleast in the same mood as you right now, and this guy most probably has the perfect music for you. All you do is find this playlist, and then click on Play. WJ exports the playlist as .m3u (or other popular playlist formats) and you can listen to the music for another couple of hours without bothering to individually siphon out the right songs from the entire collection.

Everything sounds nice and cool, but the catch is that WJ right now has only free songs (not your mainline commercial RIAA-owned shit). But as far as I can see, Yahoo! will most probably apply this technology to their music store in the near future. Just let people make their playlists and then offer a "Download this playlist" button. Anyways as of now I'm enjoying good quality free music without pissing off RIAA :)

And btw, WJ is IIRC a one-man company - <a href="http://www.gonze.com">Lucas Gonze</a>! I don't know how much he made, but must be enough to buy himself a new car and  a new home :)
