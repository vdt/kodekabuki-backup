Just installed Google Earth on my new Dell laptop. Everytime I install Earth, I find something new and interesting - this time it is <a href="http://www.fboweb.com/antest/ge/intro.aspx">Floweb.com's</a> live flight tracking system embedded into Google Earth. All you need to do is to download Google Earth, and then open the Floweb.com's .kml feed (google's geo markup language) with Google Earth. Google Earth shows all the incoming flights to the airport whose feed you opened - all the info is real-time updated every 30 secs. It even shows the aircraft's exact altitude and speed :)


This is really scary considering 9/11 but apparently all this information has been available to the public even before Google Earth came out - Google Earth has just made it easy to view, that's all!
