The following is just a copy-paste job from Entrepreneur27.org - Stanford's symposium. 27 apparently refers to the age limit (upper bound) of the founders of these startups!

Flagr
<blockquote>Find a killer burrito place? Stumble upon an awesome party? Flag it, tag it, and share its location with your friends at <a href="http://flagr.com/" title="Flagr.com">Flagr</a>, directly from your cell phone or home computer. At <a href="http://flagr.com/" title="Flagr.com">Flagr.com</a>, you can share all your favorite venues, broadcast your most recently visited locations, exchange mobile media, plan events, and find new things to do in the real world. Flagr provides a refreshing incentive to venture out and experience something new.
</blockquote>Standpoint
<blockquote><a href="http://www.standpoint.com/" title="Standpoint.com">Standpoint</a> is a collaborative encyclopedia of opinion, where people organize the web by belief, enabling new ways to find information. Learn about any claim in the world. Take a stand on the ones you believe. Build your own case for why you believe it, and meet others who share your point of view. <a href="http://www.standpoint.com/" title="Standpoint.com">Standpoint</a>: What do you believe? </blockquote>Box.net
<blockquote><p><a href="http://box.net/" title="Box.net">Box.net</a> was founded in the fall of 2004 and launched in 2005 with the purpose of providing users with a low-cost, easy to use online storage solution. </p>   <p>In a series of surveys of randomly selected consumers, we
found that a shockingly low number of people rated storing, sharing, and retrieving data as â€œfun,â€ â€œexhilarating,â€ or even â€œeasy and kind of nice to do.â€ <a href="http://box.net/" title="Box.net">Box.net</a> hopes to change all that. </p>   <p>Box.net currently has 4,000 paying subscribers, and is
about to relaunch its premium service with both free and pay options. Box.net is funded by angel investors consisting of a group of Seattle businessmen and Mark Cuban.</p></blockquote>Bill Monk
<blockquote><p>We want to ease the strains of finances on friendships. Do you feel like youâ€™re always leaking money to your friends? Do the tensions run high between housemates whenever bills are due? Does the unpleasantness of dividing restaurant bills make you want to bury your head under the tablecloth? Do you scribble IOUs which you intend to pay but quickly forget?</p>   <p>Thatâ€™s where we come in. Our patent-pending technology makes it super-easy for you to tell us about bills using your cell phone or web browser, and then we do all the work of figuring who owes whom how much. This service is absolutely free.

<blockquote>     *  Wondering what your friends are up to this weekend?     * Wanna get some co-workers together for a happy hour?     * Trying to find tonightâ€™s hot spot?   <p>Skobee can help.</p></blockquote><p>Read more about these startups at <a href="http://www.entrepreneur27.org/">Entrepreneur27.org</a> - Stanford Conference </p>
