Guy Kawasaki says
<strong></strong><blockquote><strong>Judge others by their intentions and yourself by your results</strong>.  If you want to be at peace with the world, here's what you should do. When you  judge others, look at what they intended to do. When you judge yourself, look at  what you've actually accomplished. This attitude is bound to keep you humble. By  contrast, if you judge others by their accomplishments (which are usually  shortfalls) and yourself by your intentions (which are usually lofty), you will  be an angry, despised little man.</blockquote><a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Kawasaki's blog</a> is slowly climbing up my favorite blogs list day-by-day!
