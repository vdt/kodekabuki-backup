Thats the talk of the town atleast in Indian-origin techie blogs for the past 1 week. Initially I resisted typing this post (considering that I strictly restrict myself to technology and the only place where I really get close to something debate-able is opensource). But, after the following things which happened in no particular order, I cannot sleep without typing this one. So here I am typing this at 3:33 AM on a Friday nite or rather Sat morning.

1. Mark Shuttleworth's talk

I recently had the chance to listen to Mark Shuttleworth talk about Ubuntu and his opensource efforts. He appeared to be a nice guy and he even agreed to take a picture with me even though he was in a real hurry to catch his flight at Changi. Well I know I'm biased but....

There was one thing which captivated me during the talk. Someone asked him as to whether things like "Linux or Negromento's $100 laptop" ever succeed. So the question is "will they ever succeed?" Shuttleworth's reply was that the success of an individual project like Negromonte's does not matter - what really matters is the awareness, the 'jagran' as to put it the desi way, and the conversation which gets going because of one such project; which is actually true if you think about it - I think what Negromonte has achieved with his project irrespective of whether it succeeds or fails is to get people talking about it all over the media - Forbes, BusinessWeek, NYTimes, just everywhere! That's what matters frankly!

So lets stop the I-don't-think-they-will-succeed thing now please?

2. Paul Graham's new essay - <a href="http://paulgraham.com/love.html">Doing what you love</a>!

Just explains it - they're not a bunch of losers - they're doing just what they love to do; forget about being right or wrong, forget about whether it'll work or not!

3. Rang de basanti

I might be a bit high on all this stuff - I just watched Rang de basanti :)

4. Prof. Sadagopan's observations

Read this</a>!

So enough of reasons which were instrumental in driving me to post this! Lets just wish them goodluck, and hopefully they'll set a good example esp. since they're the first ones - oh boy, the one thing that we don't want is the first guys to set a very negative example which would make it all the more difficult for the forthcoming ones!
