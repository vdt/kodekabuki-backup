Paul Graham - I just love this guy's essays - very simple, straightforward, no jargon, no business school shit to make you artifically believe it is intellectual, but at the same time so useful!

Read his latest essay on "<a href="http://paulgraham.com/love.html">Prestige vs. doing what you love</a>" - simply awesome!
<blockquote>Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy.  It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.</blockquote>One more...
<blockquote>Donald Hall said young would-be poets were mistaken to be so obsessed with being published. But you can imagine what it would do for a 24 year old to get a poem published in The New Yorker. Now to people he meets at parties he's a real poet. Actually he's no better or worse than he was before, but to a clueless audience like that, the approval of an official authority makes all the difference. So it's a harder problem than Hall realizes. The reason the young care so much about prestige is that the people they want to impress are not very discerning.</blockquote>
