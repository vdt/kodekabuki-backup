It's interesting how many ideas showcased at this year's DEMO conference were actually envisioned by me and my friends while brainstorming for a startup business plan competition. The following are some of the ideas we came up with (not essentially the same in all aspects, but more or less similar) :-
<blockquote><a href="http://www.zimini.com">Zimini</a>: announces the beta availability of a its online coupon platform. It is based on a piece of software that consumers install on their PC, in which they enter their personal profile. This will allow these consumers to receive promotional offers that match that profile, are always up-to-date, and avoid being spammed as nauseam because they were one interested in one specific promotion. Online merchants will use Zimini to build their campaigns, and limit the scope of their offer to relevant consumers. Intriguing. <b>(We envisioned a system where the user actually queries for yellow pages information, and these promos/coupons will be targeted at the user based on his query).</b>

<a href="http://www.sproutit.com/">Sprout Systems</a>: announces MailRoom, a solution for small businesses to manage, prioritize and in some cases automatically reply, to the email they are receiving (stats mentioned is that SMBs spend up to 50% of their time answering). It is based on a Web-based UI that provides ready-made forms, email answers and workflows to speed up email management. This sounds interesting, but I am concerned about the scalability of the demoâ€™ed solution to hundreds of emails, and thousands of contacts. <b>(I wanted to do a starter IT kit for SMBs which includes email among other things and the kit is hosted on our servers essentially an on-demand model so that the people at the SMB are relieved from all the nitty-gritty issues of in-house IT management.)</b>

<a href="http://sharpcast.com/">SharpCast</a>: new Photo management solution that offers seamless mobile, pc and web access of the same library. Modifications done to a photo on one incarnation of the system is transparently replicated on others (in quasi real-time). Photos is the first media type made supported by SharpCast, which will offer others in the future, as well as a set of APIs. <b>(We didn't just think of photos - we thought about doing this for all files on your PC!).</b>

<a href="http://www.locamoda.com/">LocaModa</a>: technology â€œpowering the web outsideâ€. Allows brands to connect with audiences in concerts, cafes, etc. by displaying on a large screen or a website  messages received via emails/text messages or RSS (<a href="http://www.wiffiti.com/screenView/?loc=wiffiti-demo06-macmini2&amp;type=full">this</a> is an example). A second application enables consumers looking at a screen in the street to drive the content of that screen via a cell phone (<a href="http://www.locamoda.com/media/">this</a> is an application in the real estate market). <b>(Ours: We didn't think of making that ad-screen so interactive like LocaModa, but we came up with the same idea of a distributed ad dispersal system for electronic billboards! At one point, we did think of interactivity too - we decided to solve the problem by using touch screens but were still speculative of the economic feasibility of it. I like to refer to LocaModa's technology as a WYSIWYG IVR)</b>.
