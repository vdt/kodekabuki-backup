Nick Gall on Web 2.0 and open architectures:

Beware: this guy is also a lawyer apart from being a geek.

The 3 main characteristics of web 2.0 according to him:
<ol><li>R/W web - web is transforming into a R/W medium from the Read-only format. Eg: wikis</li><li>Back-linking - web is transforming into a forward-and-backward linking system from the forward-only system. For instance, Google's entire PageRank algorithm is focussed on backlinks - Go read about <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html">BackRub in Wired's article on Google</a>!</li><li>Scale downward - web has started to scale downward apart from scaling upward (scaling globally). What he means in other words is that many new trends from the Web 2.0 soup bowl like AJAX, web services are essentially inter-process communications (ok stop being pedantic now, this guy is a lawyer after-all). Further, he argues that Infiniband is basically IPv6 (cool, I didn't know that!). PCIex is also a packet-based protocol. So as we progress well into web 2.0 in the coming years, TCP/IP will start getting used for everything - inter-process, intra-process, inter-computer communication. And since it can be used for everything, the two nodes communicating can be anywhere on the web 2.0 - for instance, an AJAX-based widget sitting inside the browser talking to Flickr's web service.</li></ol>
