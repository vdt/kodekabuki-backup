<div> <p> Watch <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2908992801860645885">How Databases Changed the World</a> [2h @Google Video] by Computer History Museum.Chris Date (though no Ted Codd) is one the members on the panel! </p>  <p> One of the members on the panel from Informix had a really interesting answer to the question "what will be the next paradigm shift in the database world just like how relational database was back then?" According to him, with the popularity of wireless sensor networks and their huge potential real life applications, databases of the future are going to be more like "monitoring databases" rather than the current "transactional databases". In other words, instead of running a query through the data to get the results (current SQL model), in the future we would be running data through our queries (event-driven model).
  </p>  <p> Chris Date on XML: "XML allows us to ignore thinking about what we should be doing but focuses on how we should do it". </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>  </p> </div>
