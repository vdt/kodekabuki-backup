Read about <a href="http://www.seventymm.com">Seventymm.com</a> in a blog - they just launched an online DVD rental service in Bangalore and are thinking of expanding to other big cities in the following months. 

The Netflix model might work in India, but will have a few nitty-gritty operational issues in India. From their website, it looks like they're going to deliver the DVDs themselves and not use the Indian Post or private courier service (or they probably outsourced it to a courier company?). If you do not deliver the DVDs yourself in India, you're in big trouble in India - people might just lie that they haven't received their DVDs eventhough they did and it might also apply the other way round too. So I guess this right, though I wonder how much this Home Delivery thing is costing them and I wonder how they're going to scale up to all the cities.

Online Payment : Normally online rental services accept only credit cards as payment. I do not see this mechanism working anytime soon in India. But this shouldn't be a problem, if they're doing Home Delivery. They can just accept cash payment for that month's rental fee.

Anyways they're quite clever; they played it safe by charging a refundable deposit of Rs. 2000/-

Talking about India, I googled for online DVD rental service in Singapore and I did find one - <a href="http://www.hollywoodclicks.com">Hollywoodclicks.com</a>. This service apparently was started by a couple of American guys in 2003. Never heard of it before though but thanks to Google. They infact have a free 14-day trial period - should try it out sometime!
