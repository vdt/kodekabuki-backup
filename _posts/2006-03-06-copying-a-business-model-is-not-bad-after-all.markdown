 I always used to have doubts if it's worthwhile to just plainly copy the business model of a successful Silicon Valley company and make it available in some other geographical region. But, I guess the key is to choose a region which you know the best, which you think the original company would not enter anytime soon, and before they even have the resources to think about entering your local market, build a strong user base leaving them no option but to acquire you.  </p>  <p> Baazee.com did it in India. Now priceme.nz did it in New Zealand though eBay was not the one who's buying them out. So, I guess it's after-all not that bad to copy someone else, because it does seem pay to shit-load of money! </p> <p>technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ebay" rel="tag">ebay</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/model" rel="tag">model</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/acquisition" rel="tag">acquisition</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/money" rel="tag">money</a></p></div>
