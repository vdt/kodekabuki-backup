 Atleast one guy writes about what I've been feeling frustrated with in the past few months - the people building these web2.0 apps are very young (most probably just out of college) and most importantly, since building these apps doesn't need a lot of upfront investment (apart from their time which they have anyways - they're nerds after all!), they keep building these cool apps as their hobby and then just release them for free without ever thinking about making money out of it because it was just their hobby!   </p>  <p> If this is going to continue, soon almost every new startup will be expected to release their new cool app for free because of excessive competition from the free ones and this network effect would bring down almost everyone along with it because soon people are going to run out of money. Seriously we need to put a stop to this madness. Except the software industry, I don't see anyone else being this generous when it comes to giving away hardwork for free!  </p>  <p> The problem with these web2.0 startups seems to be the same as with some opensource projects - these people are highly ethusiastic about their hobbies, and sometimes forget that <strong>"one is not evil if one tries to make money out of a hobby!"</strong> . Ah this reminds me of that famous letter which little Bill Gates wrote to the hobbyists regarding the BASIC interpreter :) We're facing the same problem again because of these web2.0 hobbyists.
