<div> <p> <a href="http://www.indplay.com/GetFilmDetailsAction.do?filmId=2686992">inDplay - an indie or independent film and movie rights licensing platform and directory</a> </p>  <p> Heard about inDplay via some VC blog - apparently Eric Schmidt is also an investor. It's a marketing platform for independent movie makers. Anyways that link takes you to one of the independent movies I found on their website - a documentary on the Maha Kumbh Mela by an American dude! Watch the trailer - looks interesting! </p> <a> <p>    </p>  </div>
