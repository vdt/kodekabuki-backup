<div> <p> It's official - my self-imposed Windows stint ends tonight! I'm back to Kubuntu. How long did it last? 2 months approx. Why in the first place did I switch to Windows? To try out some cool Windows-only stuff and also partly because I borrowed my dad's new Dell laptop which came with Windows XP installed. Why the switch now? Inspite of having McAfee AV Scan running all the time, I still got infected by some spambot virus - it seems to be using my Outlook account to send out mails to others! I've been generally way too cautious while using WinXP and yet this happened. I used Ad-aware regularly. I checked up Startup Inspector for any suspicious stuff. Anyways what was interesting is I lasted for 2 months without any major hiccups!<strong>  </strong> </p>  <p> <strong>  Last.fm</strong> </p>  <p> Anyways to get back to what I wanted to talk about - Last.fm! This is one hell of a service; the best I've seen as of now in this area. Yahoo! Music and Webjay are officially no more on my Favorites list from now! Last.fm basically is a free live music streaming service with folksonomy support inbuilt. It lets people tag their music, their favorite bands, etc. It lets you to add friends, view their playlists, view what they're listening to at this particular moment, and provide a personalised music page for every user. Here's <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/mallipeddi/">mine!</a> The best part is they've a client for Linux which just works right off the shelf!  </p>  <p> Webjay was a pretty good idea. But seriously most of the links in those playlists didn't work most of the time! Most playlists had like a 50% success rate and even if the links were not broken, there was always a buffering problem because you stream from different servers and each one of them has a different bandwidth. And most of the songs were illegal versions and so there's always a high chance that the links will be broken very quickly. </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>  </p> <p>technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/last.fm" rel="tag">last.fm</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/music" rel="tag">music</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/linux" rel="tag">linux</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/client" rel="tag">client</a></p></div>
