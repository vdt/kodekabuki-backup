<div> <p> I just finished reading this article <a href="http://www.digitaliq.com/parser.php?nav=email_article&amp;article_id=951">::: Digital IQ Magazine :::</a>. This is something I thought about and <a href="http://mallipeddi.blogspot.com/2005/12/bluetoothproximity-marketing-and.html">written about</a> in my blog long time back. Mobile data charges are very expensive. People are not going to use expensive OTA transfers to download rich media content because they already paid quite a lot for the content itself. This I think can be an attractive medium or a sales channel to sell rich mobile content. Atleast once a few hundred of these start springing up in Singapore, the carriers would realise what they're losing and better think about revising their data charges. Right now they're just ridiculous and are essentially impeding a lot of innovation which might have happened already in this space, if not for these greedy carriers.
