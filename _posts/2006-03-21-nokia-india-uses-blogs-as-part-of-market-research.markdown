 </blockquote>  <p>  <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2006/03/21.html#a818">Conversations with Dina</a>  </p>  <p>  According to Dina Mehta, Nokia India hired <font size="2">AC Nielsen ORG MARG to</font> <font size="2">conduct <strong>web-ethnography</strong> (webnography) based on blogging sites and online discussion forums to get a feedback on its fashion series models.</font> </p> <blockquote><em><font size="2">Through web search engines, the research firm used a simple methodology of finding relevant content in a natural context on online blogging sites and discussion forums. As these contents occurred naturally on the web, it was real consumer context as opposed to the contrived/constructed contexts of focus groups used in qualitative research.</font></em></blockquote>Right now they just seem to use keyword-based searching on regular search engines to acquire the interesting info. I think this seems to justify my idea of building a blog conversation tracker tool specially tailored at marketing research folks to make their job a hell lot easier than this.
