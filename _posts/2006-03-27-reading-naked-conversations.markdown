Just started reading Scoble's <a href="http://www.nakedconversations.com">Naked Conversations</a>. Very interesting read until now (just finished the 3rd chapter!). Scoble's book seems to be quite popular among NUS students. The library has allowed me to loan the book only for a week and very much in line with the Singaporean affection for fines, I will be charged at the rate of $1/hr for any delay in returning!

A few interesting things to note from the book...
<ul><li>Even though I'm a big fan of <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com">Channel 9</a>, I never managed to find out why it was called so. According to the book, Channel 9 was inspired by a specific radio channel in United Airlines flights which let the passengers listen to the communications happening inside the cockpit. [they wanted to reflect the same level of 'open'ness].

</li><li>Why do people go through such efforts to help others, most of whom they've never met? Why do people lend headphones to strangers on planes or tell their life stories to cab drivers? Yossi Vardi [ICQ's creator] told us the world's second favorite entertainment is story telling, but the top is conversations.

Collaborating is human nature - Striatum, a primitive brain sector, secretes 5 times the normal level of dopamine (the chemical that activates during such stimulating activities as sex and gambling) when humans are collaborating.

Humans are wired to collaborate. Altruism turns people on even more than making money.
</li></ul>
