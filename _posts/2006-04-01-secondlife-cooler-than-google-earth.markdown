Ever since I heard about SecondLife, I've been in awe for what it has achieved both in the technical CS aspects and in the social space front. Recently I stumbled upon a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5182759758975402950&amp;q=second+life&amp;pl=true">video</a> (@Google Video) in which the Second Life folks give a presentation+demo to the Googlers themselves. Go watch <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5182759758975402950&amp;q=second+life&amp;pl=true">it</a> - it's better than any university CG lecture!
<p>One of the most interesting things about Second Life is the folks at Linden Lab have figured out a way to build their architecture in such a way that the SL can scale linearly with the amount of new land which gets created on SL. It's almost something like one 1U Linux simulator engine for every 16 acres of SL land and all the players and objects in that 16 acres. So with an equation like this, they can scale upto a world of any size, because for every 16 acres they just need to buy a new 1U Linux box and throw it onto the server farm. 
</p><p>Also you must remember that inorder for people to buy and utilise these new 16 acre virtual regions, they need to buy land first, pay propety taxes, pay for the objects needed to build anything worth building in that space and all this requires Linden dollars and Linden Labs sells them in exchange for real money! They way it looks to me, Linden Labs have an endless source of revenue unlike conventional games which have a shelf life of probably something less than 1-2 years. Also one more interesting thing is that because SL is driven by an almost real life sort of economy supported by Linden dollars, somehow all the abnormalities are ironed out automagically just like in the real world. </p>Read more about <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030916/rosedale_pfv.htm">Second Life's backend in this paper</a> by Cory Ondrejka himself.
