There are direct flights from Kolkata and Delhi to Paro airport, but they seem to have too many restrictions on tourists visiting their country which  is actually a good idea (actually that makes it even more appealing). One more interesting thing is Bhutan - the modern name for the country comes from the Sanskrit word "Bhu-Uttan", meaning "High Land". Never realised that the word Bhutan is Sanskrit until now!</p>
