<div> <p> I got this spam today which just said this: </p> <blockquote> <p> <strong>Call out Gouranga be happy...
 Gouranga Gouranga Gouranga
 That which brings the highest happiness!</strong> </p> </blockquote> <p> It was sent from one Neateye [nitaigouranga@aol.com]. </p>  <p> I must say this was the first time I'd a smile on my face when I received spam in my inbox. Anyways since I know of ISKCON and visit their temples often, I knew who was Gouranga and what the contents of the email meant. Apparently no one knows who is behind this (some claim it's ISKCON Scotland). There is also some confusion if this was the work of gamers who might have heard about Gouranga because of an easter egg in GTA [I'm not much of a gamer!]. </p>  <p> You can read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouranga">Gouranga in Wikipedia</a>.
