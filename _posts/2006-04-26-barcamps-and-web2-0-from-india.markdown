<p> From a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ft-dotcoms24apr24,1,2224886.story?coll=la-headlines-technology&ctrack=1&cset=true">LATimes article</a> :

<blockquote><p> The country is home to only a handful of consumer Internet companies, all but a few with revenue below $10 million. But an ever-expanding population of online users is expected to turn some of them into rivals of Yahoo or Amazon. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Industry observers frequently see China, whose consumer Internet sector has about a dozen dot-coms each generating at least $100 million in revenue annually, as a model for India's future.</p>

<p> Meanwhile two new Web 2.0 startups from India have just launched - <a href="http://www.seraja.com">SEraja</a> and <a href="http://www.taazza.com/">Taazza</a>. </p>

<p> SEraja as their logo says is an event tracking engine. They go around crawling the web and indexing any new and upcoming events they can spot. It can be quite useful if they can get it right. Localisation of information is probably going to be very important. It looks like it has been completely developed in Bangalore, India though the man behind it is a UC, Irvine prof. Sanjay Jain. He even has a <a href="http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/blog/">nice blog</a> - pretty cool for a CS prof eh? Hmm...when will the profs at NUS start blogging? </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.taazza.com/">Taazza</a> (means 'fresh' in Hindi) was recently demoed at BarCamp Chennai and BarCamp Bangalore. It is still not open to public. Anyways it is a news mashup/meme tracker targetted specially at the Indian audience. From the screenshots, it looks pretty interesting. As the founder says, Indian news sites have a long traditional of being the most horrible things on the web - extremely ugly designs, too many banner ads mostly either convincing you to get married or to search for a new IT job in Bangalore. I'm just glad that Taazza might change the scene! </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arunram/">Look at pictures from both BarCamp Chennai and BarCamp Bangalore</a>! BarCamp is really spreading like fire back in India. It all started with BarCamp Delhi (ya they beat Bangaloreans once, we'll catch up next time!). Then there was BarCamp Hyderabad. BarCamp Mumbai is next on the list. And if you still think it's not big deal, take this: there's supposedly a BarCamp Salem!!
