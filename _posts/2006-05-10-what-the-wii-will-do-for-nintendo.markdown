<div><p><img alt="Wii" border="1" height="77" src="http://www.playfeed.com/blogimages/wii.jpg">I just finished watching the demo of Nintendo Wii in the US. I must say it is a real Revolution (they should have just stuck with this name!).</p><p>As they seem to subtly mention a lot of times in the keynote, Nintendo is mainly interested in getting more people on-board the gaming world. They are not seriously targetting it at those serious Halo 2/WoW/NFS fans from the XBox and the PS2 world. Infact they end the demo with the words, "the feel of the game is more important than the looks of the game...". So they do not want you to buy one if you want cutting-edge graphics and awesome realism. </p><p>Why is this good for Nintendo? First of all, this different focus gives them two advantages: they can offer the console at a much cheaper price compared to PS3 and Xbox 360, and the second one will be that they will not be directly competing with the XBox or the PS3. They're cleverly letting Microsoft and Sony battle it out. Meanwhile they'll be attracting a lot of casual gamers and first-time gamers who will be attracted to Wii because of its simplicity, fun factor (you should see their demo video where they show how easy and fun it is to play tennis) and also cheaper price.</p><p>If Nintendo can ensure that there is enough good content for their console, I'm pretty sure that within 1-2 years there are going to be a hella lot of female gamers hooked up to Nintendo Wiis. The game play is finally simple enough to attract girls - that's another chunk of the market just for themselves! I just love their approach!</p><p>Will I buy a Nintendo Wii? Probably ya! I'm the sort of guy who used to play a lot of games when I was a kid (I owned a Sega console back then). But I just quit gaming gradually as I grew older, as games became just too complicated for me - I like simple stuff! If there are more than 2 buttons that I need to be worried about at an instant of time, then I'm pretty much not going to bother playing that game again. Hopefully, the Nintendo Wii will solve this problem.
