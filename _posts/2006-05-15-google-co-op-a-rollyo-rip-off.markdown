<a href="http://rollyo.com/img/logo-unreg-plain.gif"><img src="http://rollyo.com/img/logo-unreg-plain.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a>Google recently launched <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/">Google Co-op</a>. It pretty much looks like what the startup <a href="http://www.rollyo.com">Rollyo</a> has been trying to do for quite sometime. Incidentally, Rollyo uses Yahoo! Search underneath. What is even more surprising is all of a sudden, Google switched to the idea of tapping into collective human intelligence for better search add-ons. Sergey has been found stating several times (including one interview which I watched myself) that tagging is interesting only if done automatically by the computer. So why the sudden change of opinion inside the Googleplex? What happened to the cool algorithmic solutions which they used to roll-out to impress people like me?<div><p>Anyways Google Co-op is still a very interesting API. It is still not mature enough (expecting people to pump-in all their query data objects into a static XML specs file is not sophisticated enough!).
</p><p>Though when it becomes mature, using Google is going to be more fun than ever. Imagine the scenario where all the third-party web services you use neatly plugin to the Google.com results page UI right at the top where you need. I'm more interested in the "Subscription Links" feature than the community-built topic search list idea. Lets wait and see if things catch on...</p><p>Meanwhile Google also launched an update to Google Desktop Search last week. Now GDS also supports a Gadgets API which lets developers create Konfabulator-like widgets. Yet another rip-off? Boy...what the hell happened to Google all of a sudden?
