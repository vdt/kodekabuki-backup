For a long time, I have been using <a href="http://amsn.sourceforge.net">AMSN</a>, opensource MSN client even on Windows XP because it is lighter on memory requirements. Anyways a couple of weeks back I installed the Windows Live Messenger (beta) - pretty good IM client overall. But what is interesting is how they've transformed MSN IM client as a marketing platform.

Today there was an ad inviting me to download avatars for the Messenger but the catch is that it is sponsored by Samsung which is trying to promote their new MP3 player. So I click it, go to their site, design an avatar, and at the end of the chain, Samsung forces me to select one of their MP3 players as an accessory for my avatar and you can see the end-product on the left! Nice way to market your product!

It is interesting to note that Yahoo! doesn't seem to monetize their IM/network much and neither is GTalk (too young I guess). Yahoo! is more interested in integrating the IM with the tons of content which they've online which is quite understandable because they've enough content with them which they need to promote unlike MSN. According to the MSN team, Microsoft is slowly going to move away from the content business, infact pull down the MSN site in lots of countries which is to be replaced by Live.com.

There's going to be a point when whatever you type in the messenger window is going to be sent over to their ad servers and relevant ads extracted and flushed back to your IM window. There are lots of other interesting things you can do actually. If someone is talking about "DaVinci Code", then you can display a link which would help the person buy the book or if the IM client is intelligent enough to figure out the person was talking about the movie, then it can pull out the show timings based on his location and give him a link to book tickets. Though we need to build and follow a good set of design guidelines, so that you don't annoy people with your cool NLP tricks!
