<div><p>Anyways there was an interesting article by Cringley on Slashdot regarding Google click fraud. I figured that I totally neglected this aspect of Google (which actually contributes to 99% of their revenue) in my blog (am I another Google fanboy or what?). This post is mostly going to be a summary of what I have gathered by visiting the links mentioned at the end of this post:</p>  <p>What's going wrong in the pay-per-click (PPC) adverstising world?</p>  <p>1. Competitor's envy: 
 </p>  <p>You bid for a Google AdWord and win the auction. Your ad gets shown on the Google Search page whenever a relevant query was entered by a user in the Sponsored Links section/Advertisements section of the Google homepage. Your competitor hires cheap labor, gives him/her a PC with broadband connection and asks them to click on your ad continously and by the end of the month you'll get a hefty from Google for all the clicks. (Ok, this might not work anymore because Google's click fraud prevention software should be sophisticated enough to capture all clicks coming from the same computer).</p>  <p>2. Personal greed + intentional damage: 
 </p>  <p>You sign up for a Google AdSense (affliate programme) account. This lets you to display Google's ads on your page and as part of the affliate programme, Google shares their PPC revenue originating from any clicks on your page. So you become greedy and start clicking on the ads on your own page trying to squeeze money from Google.</p>  <p>3. Parked domains/Google-approved greed: 
 </p>  <p>Parked domains are essentially empty/unused domains with no useful content hosted in them. Apparently, Google itself encourages parked domains to make use of the free space to display some of their ads and make money when confused visitors end up at these sites and click on the ads. Most of these parked domains are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting">typo-squatted</a> - popular domain names with typos. Microsoft Research has this nice tool called URL Tracer which can automatically generate all possible typos for a given domain name and automatically crawl all these generated URLs (if they exist), and log the ad servers supplying the ads being shown on such sites. Apparently, according to their research, almost 90% of such sites seem to be using Google's Ad Sense to display ads (the logs repeatedly turn up with an entry for oingo.com!). Ouch! Nice little revenge from Redmond on their Mountain View rivals eh? What really struck me is that Google seems to approve this sort of thing. Google acquired this startup called Applied Semantics/Oingo and I guess that there's a good amount of their code powering Google's AdSense. Visit <a href="http://www.oingo.com">http://www.oingo.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/domainpark/">http://www.google.com/domainpark/</a> for more info.</p>  <p>4. Personal greed + unintentional damage: 
 </p>  <p>Greed is a very difficult thing to control and soon it can manifest into organised crime. If you live in India, you would frequently see these small ads in the classifieds of your local newspaper, appealing to bored housewives to come make quick money online. The ad would go on to mention the requirements: "all you need is a PC with an internet connection and 2 hours of spare time which you can devote to clicking on the ads appearing on the list of URLs which we send to your email inbox every morning. And at the end of the month, a nice little paycheck awaits you in your snail mail :)" I remember I had to warn my mother not to do this because she was also very excited to pick up the phone and call one of these guys. Very difficult to explain to your mother that just clicking a few ads in your bedroom in India every night before going to bed can devastate a startup in Illinois :)</p>  <p>5. Personal greed + cool hackery:</p>  <p>Until now I have talked about normal people getting greedy. Now comes the story about the greediness of the nerdy ones in the community. Yes they can be more devastating :)</p>  <p>Recently there have been reports of lots of clickbots which are essentially a huge cluster of zombie PCs connected to the internet and being controlled by a hacker instructing them to click on the ads on certain pages trying to make money with all this happening without the knowledge of the infected PC's owners. Looks like all the brains behind organised spam are giving click fraud some of their eyeballs. Now something like this is going to be harder for the click fraud prevention teams at Googleplex or Yahoo! to detect if they wanted to.
 </p>  <p>6. Corporate scam/conspiracy:</p>  <p>Some people claim that Google is behind the whole thing? Or even if it is not, they atleast are not assigning enough 'we are highly excited about what we do' phds to work on this because it can cause a drastic negative effect on their short-time profits. Anyways if they do not solve this problem, the whole industry is probably not going to be in a position anywhere close to what it is right now.
