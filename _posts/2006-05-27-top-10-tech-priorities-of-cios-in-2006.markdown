 <p>(via: ZDNet)</p>  <p>I was just wondering the Top 10 list shown above (and which I stole from ZDNet) is a good place to start brainstorming for ideas to solve these major IT problems/concerns of the CIOs in a web 2.0'ish way. It will be nice to see a highly successful web2.0ish enterprise app.</p>  <p>PS: Don't drill me as to what exactly I meant by the word web2.0'ish in the above paragraph. I don't have an answer but something inside me beeps whenever I see web2.0 around me and that's how I know it :)
