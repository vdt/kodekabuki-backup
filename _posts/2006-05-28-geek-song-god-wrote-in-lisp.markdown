<strong>Lyrics:</strong>
<blockquote>I was taught assembler in my second year of school.

Itâ€™s kinda like construction work â€” with a toothpick for a tool.
So when I made my senior year, I threw my code away,
And learned the way to program that I still prefer today.
Now, some folks on the Internet put their faith in C++.
They swear that itâ€™s so powerful, itâ€™s what God used for us.
And maybe it lets mortals dredge their objects from the C.
But I think that explains why only God can make a tree.
For God wrote in Lisp code
When he filled the leaves with green.
The fractal flowers and recursive roots:
The most lovely hack Iâ€™ve seen.
And when I ponder snowflakes, never finding two the same,
I know God likes a language with its own four-letter name.
Now, Iâ€™ve used a SUN under Unix, so Iâ€™ve seen what C can hold.
Iâ€™ve surfed for Perls, found what Fortranâ€™s for,
Got that Java stuff down cold.
Though the chance that Iâ€™d write COBOL code
is a SNOBOLâ€™s chance in Hell.
And I basically hate hieroglyphs, so I wonâ€™t use APL.
Now, God must know all these languages, and a few I havenâ€™t named.
But the Lord made sure, when each sparrow falls,
that its flesh will be reclaimed.
And the Lord could not count grains of sand with a 32-bit word.
Who knows where we would go to if Lisp werenâ€™t what he preferred?
And God wrote in Lisp code
Every creature great and small.
Donâ€™t search the disk drive for man.c,
When the listingâ€™s on the wall.
And when I watch the lightning
Burn unbelievers to a crisp,
I know God had six days to work,
So he wrote it all in Lisp.
Yes, God had a deadline.
So he wrote it all in Lisp.</blockquote>
<strong>Details:</strong>

I found this song when I was reading the bios of one of the Flock employees. Apparently he used to run an indie record label called <a href="http://www.prometheus-music.com/">Prometheus Music</a>. The song itself (a parody of "God Lives on Terra") was sung by Julia Ecklar for the album <a href="http://www.songworm.com/about/roundworm.html">Round Worm</a>.
