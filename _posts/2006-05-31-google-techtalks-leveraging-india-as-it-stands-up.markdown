I watched a video of a pretty <a target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2089147957292061314&q=leveraging+india">amazing talk by Dr. Ashok Jhunjhunwala</a>, a prof from [tag]IIT [/tag][tag]Madras[/tag]. This is one of the talks in the '<a target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=engedu">Google TechTalks</a>' series (all these talks on various topics in CS are given at Googleplexes all over the world and recorded and uploaded to Google Videos regularly for everyone to watch for free!).

This is a topic which I'm particularly interested in since I'm from India. But I would encourage anyone who is in general interested in finding out more about how India is doing in terms of infrastructure growth, opportunities for technopreneurs in India, and get a glimpse of the dreams of a billion people.

The thing I realise once again is that if you want to run a successful business in [tag]India[/tag], directly importing a glitzy piece of technology from [tag]Silicon Valley[/tag] or a hoo-hah business model from Harvard will not work largely because of economic infeasibility and unattractiveness of the solution. Both the technology and the business model (more importantly) needs to be adapted so that you actually make money and don't just bleed sitting there in the Indian sun because no one is buying your product.

I loved the part where he talked about Bharti Telecom's business model where they just own the customers and the license and some part of the backbone. The rest of the infrastructure is outsourced to big [tag]consultancy[/tag] companies like [tag]IBM[/tag] with IBM getting a fraction of the revenue for building as well as owning cum running the network for [tag]Bharti Telecom[/tag]. This is clearly what has  enabled these Indian telecom companies to scale up to huge numbers though they might lack huge upfront capital investments unlike their foreign counterparts ([tag]Vodafone[/tag], etc).
