<blockquote>Your consultants are known for being able to work from any external location. How do you enable that?

We are distributed virtually and our tech was designed for that. We don't even have a corporate headquarters. One thing we've solved is printing; it's a common thing that we all still need to be able to do. From anywhere in the world, an Accenture employee can go to our Web portal and click on the country they are in. This brings up a list of offices. After selecting an office, it asks you to select a floor. Then it brings up a floor plan of the building and points to the printers. When you click on a printer, it automatically enables the print drivers and sets it up for you. Then you can go pick up your documents.

How about determining the person's location within an Accenture building by using his mobile phone, and then automatically forwarding the job to the closest printer. Ok I agree it is not that practical. But I just loved the feeling of being able to print to any printer in any floor in any Accenture building in any city in any part of the world if you were an Accenture employee without any hassle. This is how IT should enable people's lives. Ofcourse, this is under the assumption that their solution infact works without any issues.
