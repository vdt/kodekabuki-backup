This morning I read <a href="http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2006/06/eos_airlines_lo.html">this post</a> by Rick Segal (VC in USA) in which he talks about his experience with a new Trans-Atlantic airline, EOS Airlines.

What's special about EOS airlines? Its fleet comprises of 3 "business class-only" jets and flies only between JFK and London Stansted (not Heathrow!). They boast of the fact that they carry 48 passengers in a jet meant to carry 220+ passengers. And <a href="http://www.eosairlines.com/">their website</a> introduces you to the other small niceties which they offer if you were to fly with them - right from free shoe polishes to free phone calls on-board the aircrafts.

As Rick Segal mentions in his post, what I like about them, is the way they give away small things, and get back the big favour from their customers without even asking for it - that is  to entice people to tell all their friends &amp; family about their awesome experience on-board EOS! Therein exists the purple cow!
