<div><p>The latest version of Skype for Windows has Paypal integration and SMS support. But the SMS feature seems to be fairly useless because of the ridiculously high charges. What's even more ridiculous is that the charge for making a phone call per min to USA is much less than sending an SMS to a US mobile no. As of now Taiwan, Denmark, Benin (it's a country in West Africa!) and China have the cheapest SMS charges.</p>  <p>
