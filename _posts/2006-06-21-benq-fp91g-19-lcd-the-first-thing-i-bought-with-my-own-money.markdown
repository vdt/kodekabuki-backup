With the money from my first paycheck, I finally bought what I've been wanting to buy for a long time - a 19" LCD to use as a secondary display unit alongwith my laptop. Boy 19" is really huge! I initially wanted to buy a ViewSonic 19" widescreen LCD. But the ViewSonic refused to sync with my laptop's graphics adapter. And after looking at the widescreen, I wasn't so keen on getting one either. The problem with a 19" widescreen is its height! The display looks like it has been squashed in from the top (the reason being mainly the wallpaper and the desktop icons which get stretched in a display with a 16:10 aspect ratio). If you're thinking about getting a widescreen LCD, you need to get a larger one - a 20" or higher.

Benq FP91G+ is nice - 8ms response time, analog/DVI, 1280x1024 native resolution! Since this is my first LCD panel, I cannot really comment much on its display quality. But as of now there are no dead pixels and it comes with 3 years warranty in Singapore and most importantly it works perfectly fine with my laptop's graphics adapter.

Since I do not play games and not watch a lot of DVD movies, I did not really need a bleeding edge LCD. All that I wanted is massive screen real-estate for development work. Especially these days it turns out that the way I code is to open up a browser (with a tutorial page, a page with API, and a documentation page open in separate tabs), and a editor window, and I keep switching between these two windows a million times as I'm coding. It is a huge waste of time and a really bad overall experience for me while I'm coding. Hopefully this will let me work better!

Multi-monitor support in a Dell Inspiron 2200

My laptop, a Dell Inspiron 2200 (with an inexpensive bang-for-buck configuration) comes with an Intel 915GM chipset. And the in-built Intel graphics adapter is meant to support dual-display. But the default factory-installed driver supplied by Dell will not let you setup multiple-monitors. And neither will the latest driver from Intel work for you because something in the system probably configured by Dell prevents the driver from installing. So what you should do is to go to Dell's support site, and download the latest driver supplied by Dell. The driver version lags a bit when compared to the one released by Intel but it atleast does what I need.
