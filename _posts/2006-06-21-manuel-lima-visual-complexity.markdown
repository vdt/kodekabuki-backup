Manuel Lima, the creator of the website <a href="http://www.visualcomplexity.com">VisualComplexity.com</a> talks in a <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1066.html">podcast at ITConversations.com</a>

VisualComplexity.com is not really a website - it is more like a directory of all projects which deal with the problems of visualising complex information in really cool and interesting ways!

One interesting project which Manuel talked about in the podcast was about visualising the relationships between people at Enron via the email messages they exchanged prior to the scam being unravelled. Apparently, this information has been made public and someone at NYTimes came up with this idea of building a graph with people as nodes and the links of the graph denoting an email exchange between any 2 or more employees. And the cool part is that from this graph, they were able to spot an anomaly. [<a href="http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=271">Read more on this...</a>]
