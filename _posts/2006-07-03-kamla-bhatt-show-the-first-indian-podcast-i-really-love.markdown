From what I've listened to so far, Kamla is based out of NY & Bangalore and she goes around interviewing interesting people in her [tag]podcast[/tag]. She doesn't seem to restrict herself to a particular genre though and really anything regarding India seems to suffice as potential content for her show as of now. And if you're based out of [tag]Bangalore[/tag], you got to have something related to IT in your show, don't you? :)

The following are two interesting podcast interviews by her that I really loved listening to.

<a title="How to do start-ups in India" href="http://www.kamlabhattshow.com/content/4010/secondary.html"><strong>Rene Seifert: How To Do Start-ups in India</strong></a>
<blockquote>In this one, a German entrepreneur talks about his experiences in running a services startup called [tag]Level360[/tag] out of Bangalore catering specifically to the German market. He describes (in a light funny manner) the many interesting things that he seemed to discover while hiring people in Bangalore and how he learned from those experiences.</blockquote>
<a title="Interview with Seraja CEO" href="http://www.kamlabhattshow.com/content/3070/secondary.html"><strong>Interview with Arun Katiyar, CEO SEraja</strong></a>
<blockquote>[tag]Seraja[/tag] is the event tracking engine that I've talked about before in my blog. Primarily developed out of Bangalore, it is I guess one of the biggest contributions of Bangalore to Web2.0</blockquote>
