I just discovered an interesting feature built into the latest versions of [tag]Opera[/tag] for the desktop. Just press <strong>Shift + F11</strong> or click on <strong>View -> Small Screen</strong> and Opera will render the webpage for a small screen. It is actually an emulator for their SSR technology built into the [tag]mobile[/tag] versions of Opera.

Their technique with SSR seems to be to remove the need for a horizontal scroll bar in mobile browsers when viewing pages designed for conventional [tag]browsers[/tag]. So the way they do this seems to be to just push down anything which doesn't fit within the mobile browser's screen. They are so brutal when it comes to this strategy that they infact chop off any image files into parts and display them in multiple lines. Try Google's homepage and their huge logo gets displayed in multiple chunks.
