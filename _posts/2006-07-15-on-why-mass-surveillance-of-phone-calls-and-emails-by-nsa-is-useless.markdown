title: On why mass surveillance of phone calls and emails by NSA is useless
tags: []

type: regular

---
I found this really interesting article by a Norwegian professor which explains why NSA & Bush administration's decision to monitor all the phone calls and email messages of all Americans is such a stupid idea. His arguments are based upon a simple theorem in statistics called the Bayes theorem.

In brief, the author says that the whole mass surveillance idea would seem logical and sane only if America was paranoid - paranoid enough to belief that there are around a million terrorists in America.
