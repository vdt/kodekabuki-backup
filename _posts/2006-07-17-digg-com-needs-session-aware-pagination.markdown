<p>Though Digg.com v3.0 has been released with a lot of fanfare and lot of accolades, it makes me sad that they still haven't fixed this annoying problem - the pagination in digg.com is not specific to a certain session. And the negative consequence being that reading articles in the &quot;Upcoming stories&quot; section is such a pain in the ass.<br /><br />I enter the first page of the &quot;Upcoming stories&quot; section and I check all the links one-by-one. By the time I'm done with the first page, and click on the link to the second page, I almost get the same bunch of articles on the second page too with a few new ones if I get lucky and if Digg.com is not receiving many story submissions at that time. This occurs because the pagination does not seem to be session-aware. They should be able to solve this problem easily by maintaining my state once I login and altering the pagination specifically to my session. Especially the pain caused by this problem is elevated nowadays because Digg.com is growing its user base rapidly.<br /><br />Sometimes I feel that the current user experience is almost like what you would feel if you try to climb the escalator stairs in the opposite direction!<br /><br /><small>Tags: <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/digg.com">digg.com</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/pagination">pagination</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/UI">UI</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/user+experience">user experience</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/design">design</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/bug">bug</a></small></p>
