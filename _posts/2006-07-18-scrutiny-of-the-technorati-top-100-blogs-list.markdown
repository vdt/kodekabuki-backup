<p>Today I visited the Technorati Top 100 list and saw this (screenshot taken at July 18, 2006 10:50PM GMT+0800):<br /><br /><img height="469" style="margin: 5px" width="579" alt="" src="http://poundbang.in/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/technorati_rank3_fuckedup1.jpg" /><br /><br />If you cannot spot anything interesting in the picture above, the hint is to take a look at the 3rd top blog which seems to be <strong>www.bestonlinecoupons.com</strong>. Clearly that is not a blog and not anywhere close to being one. Normally this sort of stuff does not show up in the Technorati Top 100 list. This is what got me thinking. <br /><br />What is really interesting about this is infact<strong> there should be more misidentified blogs</strong> like the one above in the top 100 list unless the top 100 list was being filtered by a human before it ever got published. The human's task will be to filter out websites which were misidentified as blogs but still got assigned a good rank (&lt;=100) because they had an extremely good <strong>number of unique inbound links and unique inbound sites</strong> (the two primary factors based upon which Technorati generates the ranking).<br /><br />Still not convinced? <strong>Have you ever thought why Technorati does not go beyond the top 100 ranks?</strong> If your answer is that Technorati is incapable of generating ranks for every blog because of the computation requirements involved, then you are wrong. Because the <strong>Technorati Bloginfo API query does infact return ranks for every blog URL</strong> that Technorati has indexed previously. For example, this new blog of mine has a rank around 800,000. So clearly they can go beyond the top 100 and do not have any problems wrt implementation and performance. Then why don't they display them? There's definitely an interest in this sort of thing in the blogosphere because people are quite crazy about Technorati rankings. So the incentive does exist for Technorati to do it.<br /><br />The answer I think will be more clear once we look at what the following three Technorati Bloginfo API queries returned:<br /><br /><strong>Case 1: Lessig's blog</strong><br /><br />URL : <strong>lessig.org</strong>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rank: <strong>284</strong><br />URL :<strong> lessig.org/blog/</strong>Â Â  Rank: <strong>445</strong><br /><br />The above two url queries return different ranks from Technorati.But what is interesting is <strong>the feed url returned for both the queries is the same</strong> which means that Technorati has been tracking the same RSS feed for both the urls whenever it has received a ping. But ofcourse the number of inbound links and inbound blogs will be different for the two urls which explains the different ranks. Taking a look at the HTML source of both the pages throws more light on why Technorati might have ended up with the same RSS feed for both the urls. The HEAD section of both the pages contains a &lt;link&gt; tag to the same RSS feed and it is also the first feed which someone would discover while parsing if you proceed from the top!<br /><br /><strong>Case 2: Flickr</strong><br /><br />URL : <strong>www.flickr.com</strong>Â Â Â  Rank: <strong>3</strong><br />URL : <strong>blog.flickr.com</strong>Â Â Â Â  Rank: <strong>15</strong><br /><br />The first query URL which is definitely not a blog gets a rank 3 and the second one which is infact a valid blog gets a rank 15. But what is interesting is<strong> neither of them can be spotted in the Technorati top 100 page</strong>! Though one sane explanation I can come up with is that the last update time reported in the XML response for both the urls was atleast a week old and hence were filtered out of the top 100 list.<br /><br /><strong>Case 3: Paul Graham's website</strong><br /><br />URL : <strong>www.paulgraham.com </strong><br />Bloginfo API RankÂ Â Â Â Â  : <strong>121</strong><br />Top 100 page RankÂ Â Â  : <strong> 80</strong><br /><br />What is interesting about Paul Graham's site is that first of all you might know that Paul Graham does not actually maintain a blog. He instead writes essays periodically. Infact he doesn't have his own RSS feed though at this page he links to two external RSS feeds generated for him by a third party. And infact Technorati also reported of indexing one of the two feeds in the XML response.<br /><br /><strong>Technorati's indexing process</strong><br /><br />As you might know, unlike Google or any other web search engine, Technorati does not go around crawling. It expects you to ping it whenever you might have updated your site by giving it the URL of your blog. Once it receives a ping, it then fetches a copy of the page at the submitted URL and updates itself. From what I have observed, the way it seems to do this is to grep the HTML source of the page at the given URL and extract any XML feeds it can find. Ofcourse it seems to be quite intelligent in spotting the blogging tool being used to maintain the blog. In the event that it can find out the blogging tool (Wordpress/Typepad/Blogger) being used, it seems to resort to pre-defined methods for extracting the feed for the blog instead of parsing the source to discover feeds. <br /><br />To the Technorati crawler app <strong>any website with a valid RSS/ATOM feed should be a blog</strong>. There's no way that it can differentiate between a normal website and a blog (atleast that's what I think it is) and this can partly be confirmed by the queries I mentioned above (www.paulgraham.com and www.flickr.com). <br /><br />So my question then is <strong>how can it be that the top 100 list is generally free of all websites misidentified as blogs</strong>? My answer is that they are filtering out certain items from the bloginfo API rankings employing humans. I think this would also explain the inconsistency in the rankings between the Top 100 page and the Bloginfo XML responses. Ofcourse this would not explain how bestonlinecoupons.com made it to the 3rd spot in the list. Maybe a human error? <br /><br />A lot of stuff above is largely based upon what I think it is and needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. But clearly the point that I want to stress here is that <strong>Technorati needs to be more transparent about how they do their ranking in the future.</strong> And they need to seriously fix the inconsistencies in ranks that I mentioned above!<br /><br /><small>Tags: <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/technorati">technorati</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/rank">rank</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/top100">top100</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/blog">blog</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/ranking">ranking</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/blogsearch">blogsearch</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/engine">engine</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/crawl">crawl</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/index">index</a></small></p>
