<blockquote cite="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/india_says_no_to_olpc/">The Indian Ministry of Education dismissed the laptop as "paedagogically suspect". Education Secretary Sudeep Banerjee said: "We cannot visualise a situation for decades when we can go beyone the pilot stage. We need classrooms and teachers more urgently than fancy tools."Banerjee said if money were available it would be better spent on existing education plans.</blockquote><p class="citation"><cite cite="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/india_says_no_to_olpc/"><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/26/india_says_no_to_olpc/">India rejects One Laptop Per Child | The Register</a></cite></p>

<p>I've <a href="http://poundbang.in/2005/12/15/craig-barret-and-negromonte-head-on/">written previously</a> about why OLPC will not work in India and pretty much as I anticipated the Indian MOE seems to have rejected the idea. <br/>

<p>There's no need for a laptop for every child in India - what they need is good and cheap textbooks and a school which has a proper roof! As far as computer literacy is concerned, there are enough cheap means to become computer literate in India. Every child in India has been seeing what rewards and perks an IT job could give them and believe me once they set their eyes upon it, they'll figure out ways to get there! No one needs to give them a laptop to get there!<br/>

<p>What India needs more is a huge network of South Korean-type web cafes offering cheap, high-speed internet access. There are a lot of such internet cafes, but most of them are run by very small players and they lack professionalism and hence the quality of the service sucks. A few big companies like Reliance Webworld and Sify iWay have entered the space but they do not seem to be making lot of money and haven't really expanded themselves the way one would have liked to see. Part of the problem lies in the lack of LAN gaming culture in India compared to the rest of Asia because these cafes make most of their money by ripping off these kids (more aptly addicts) who indulge in extremely long hours of gaming with friends.<br/>
