<blockquote cite="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/07/factchecking_my.html">Let's say you have 1,000 items and the top 100 (10%) account for 50% of the sales. Then you add another 99,000 items to the catalog, and the sales of that top 100 fall to just 25% of the total, while it takes another 900 items to make up the next 25%.  <strong>I would say that demand has shifted down the tail, because those top 100 items have dropped from half the market to just a quarter of it and the rest of the demand is spread over more items.</strong>

But by Gomes' math, we've gone from a market where 10% of products make 50% of the revenues to one where <strong>1% of the products make 50% of the revenues--in other words, it's become more hit-centric.</strong> I think this is simply a misunderstanding of basic statistics, and I'm disappointed that Gomes, despite many emails from me and at least one economist to him on this point, chose to simply say that I don't agree with that approach (but not why).</blockquote>

I'm waiting for my university's Business library to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401302378/104-7250935-5234343?n=283155">the book</a> (I'd previously requested them to buy the book and they quite happily agreed to do so!).
