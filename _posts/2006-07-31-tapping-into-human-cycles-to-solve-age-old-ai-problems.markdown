<p>I just watched this<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8246463980976635143&q=engedu"> interesting talk</a> by a prof from CMU at Google TechTalks. Basically his research is about designing interesting games for humans. These games are modelled around the human player solving really simple problems which are very difficult for computers to solve by themselves. The best example will be the problem of listing all objects in a picture. This is a very difficult task for the computer but very trivial for a human as long as he is not blind. But the nice end-result of all the gameplay is that the results from the game can be mined to help the computers solve age-old AI problems like image search.</p>
<p>The idea of utilising human cycles to solve difficult CS problems has been quite popular since a long time. What's interesting about his research is the way he designs the games to be fun and fool-proof. Amazon has been touting about their Mechanical Turk being a platform for people to do similar things. But until now the biggest problem has been the fact that no one really has found a good solution to verify the the answer provided by the humans during gameplay. They've employed repetition as a means to verifying the legitimacy of a result submitted to them by the humans.</p>
<p>Before we go into the details of how he has cleverly modelled the games to solve the problem of verification, why don't you play one of the games? Play the <a href="http://www.espgame.org">ESPgame</a>!</p>
<p><strong>The simple trick</strong></p>
<p>The simple solution is to make the games &quot;two-player&quot; instead of &quot;single-player interactive sessions&quot; which has long been the traditional interface to such games in the past. But what is even more important is that the two players are completely unaware of their partners and have no means of communicating with them (and so they cannot cheat!). <strong>The objective of the game is that the two players should agree upon a solution to the given task independently within a specific time</strong>. Now that's a clever idea. Since the players cannot communicate with each other, <strong>their only strategy to win (which requires that they agree upon something) is to utter the right answe</strong>r because the number of wrong answers are too damn huge for them to ever agree upon. </p>
<p>That's the general idea but he describes two different classes of games in the video: <strong>symmetric and asymmetric games.</strong> In symmetric games like ESPGame, the gameplay is the same for both the players. But in asymmetric ones like verbosity, the gameplay is different for the two partners. </p>
<p><strong>Practical solution in the real world?</strong></p>
<p>First thing to note is that this is govt funded research done by an academic. So he doesn't share the same concerns of a company like Google. More importantly, can such fun games be designed for all domains?</p>
<p><strong>How long are games going to be interesting?</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles which I think people will face if they follow this method is how long are such games going to be interesting to people? Two weeks, two months, two years or two decades? The popularity of the game is very crucial for the success of the project. </p>
<p><strong>Who owns the mined data?</strong></p>
<p>At some point if this becomes a little bit famous and every other startup in SV starts their own games and people realise how all these companies are tricking them into working for them and making millions, they might not like it.</p>
<p><strong>del.icio.us bookmarking service: a better game with in-built incentive to play right</strong></p>
<p>If you think about it, del.icio.us is also a similar game. But the objective here is not to win a simple (stupid) game. But the objective here is to organise your bookmarks by tagging them so that you can find them easily in the future and also to help you share them with others in a much more structured way. <strong>But the interesting thing is, as each delicious user bookmarks something selfishly for his own needs, common good still occurs</strong>. So the verification of results by playing two players simultaneously is not essential. I think in the future, if such games need to be designed such that they're practical in the real world, then I would say that they need to be somewhat like del.icio.us where there's a good incentive for the user to do the task and also a common good emerges out of all the selfish acts of the community.</p>
