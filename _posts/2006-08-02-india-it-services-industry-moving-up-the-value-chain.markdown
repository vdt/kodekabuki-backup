<blockquote cite="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2006/gb20060728_690002.htm">As a result, call centers are becoming a less important feature of the Indian business landscape. In 2000, they represented 85% of the total back-office business; now they're about 35%, according to Nasscom, India's outsourcing industry trade association. And while call centers are still growing in India, the business is expanding at about 30% annually, <strong>compared with 60% growth for nonvoice back-office work</strong>, Nasscom says. "The intellectual value of India is not at this low end, but with taking large and complex processes and improving them," says T.K. Kurien, chief executive of Wipro BPO.</blockquote><p class="citation"><cite cite="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2006/gb20060728_690002.htm"><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2006/gb20060728_690002.htm">Call Center?
