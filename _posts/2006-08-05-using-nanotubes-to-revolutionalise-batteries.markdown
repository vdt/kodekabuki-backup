"That's an effective way to store a large amount of energy," he says, "but the problem is that after many charges and discharges ... the battery loses capacity to the point where the user has to discard it."<br/>
<p>But capacitors contain energy as an electric field of charged particles created by two metal electrodes. Capacitors charge faster and last longer than normal batteries. The problem is that storage capacity is proportional to the surface area of the battery's electrodes, so even today's most powerful capacitors hold 25 times less energy than similarly sized standard chemical batteries.</p>

<p>The researchers solved this by covering the electrodes with millions of tiny filaments called nanotubes. Each nanotube is 30,000 times thinner than a human hair. <strong>Similar to how a thick, fuzzy bath towel soaks up more water than a thin, flat bed sheet, the nanotube filaments increase the surface area of the electrodes and allow the capacitor to store more energy.</strong> Schindall says this combines the strength of today's batteries with the longevity and speed of capacitors."</p>

<p><strong>It could be recharged many, many times perhaps hundreds of thousands of times, and ... it could be recharged very quickly, just in a matter of seconds rather than a matter of hours," he says.</strong></p>

<p>Batteries are a main bottleneck in designing cool and more powerful portable devices. Today you can squeeze in a lot of processing power in a small area, thrown in a larger LCD, but the biggest bottleneck is the battery because you need more power now.</p>

<p>Now someone needs to pay attention to the cost of printing ink cartridges - HP makes too much money off their cartridges!</p>
