<p>This is a very interesting documentary made by Jehane Noujaim (Egyptian American) on Al Jazeera, the controversial Qatar-based TV station. The length of the video is around 90 mins and is shot during the height of the Iraq war; largely contains the interviews of a few Al Jazeera journalists and higher-level management, shot at their headquarters in Qatar during the war period. For the first time, I felt like I was listening directly to what the Al Jazeera folks had to say on these issues instead of listening to the interpretations of the biased western media.</p>
<p>Jehane Noujaim was recently awarded the TED prize. <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=j_noujaim">Watch her speech</a> at the TED 2006 conference.</p>
<p>I highly recommend all the other <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/index.cfm?flashEnabled=1">TEDTalks</a> from the 2006 conference.</p>
