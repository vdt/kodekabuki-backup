<p>I just purchased a new <a href="http://www.netfirms.com/web-hosting-advantage">Netfirms Advantage</a> hosting account for my dad's startup. Netfirms had a special offer for CNET subscribers (20GB space + 120GB bandwidth + 2 free domain names for a whole year for $10!). It probably is the best hosting space deal I have ever seen :)</p>
<p>I'm thinking of moving this Wordpress blog to the new Netfirms account. This blog is currently hosted at <a href="http://www.asmallorange.com">ASmallOrange</a>. Overall my hosting experience with ASmallOrange for the past 2 months has been awesome especially their customer support. But they're very expensive in general and stingy when it comes to storage space ($5/mo for 400MB). The only reason I went with them previously was because I wanted to play with Django and they were supporting it (unofficially atleast).</p>
<p>Any tips on transfering Wordpress blogs to new servers are welcome!</p>
