<blockquote cite="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html">Programmers have very well-honed senses of justice. Code either works, or it doesnâ€™t. Thereâ€™s no sense in arguing whether a bug exists, since you can test the code and find out. The world of programming is very just and very strictly ordered and <strong>a heck of a lot of people go into programming in the first place because they prefer to spend their time in a just, orderly place, a strict meritocracy where you can win any debate simply by being right.</strong></blockquote><p class="citation"><cite cite="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html"><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html">A Field Guide to Developers - Joel on Software</a></cite></p>

<p/><p>I just love that last line in bold. Even if you ignore a lot of other stuff in his article, you need to remember this one thing about programmers!<br/>
