<blockquote cite="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/bloggers-block-4-ruby-and-java-and.html"><strong>Every language has a complexity ceiling, and it's determined by a whole slew of policy and design decisions within the language, not the libraries</strong>. The slew includes the type system (with its attendant hundreds of mini-policies), and the syntax, and it also includes the <strong>language's consistency: the ratio of rules to exceptions.<br /><br /></strong>Java's demonstrating quite clearly that at a certain level of complexity, the libraries and frameworks start to collapse under their own weight. <strong>People are always writing &quot;lightweight&quot; replacements for existing fat Java libraries and frameworks, and then the replacements get replaced, ad infinitum</strong>. But have you ever seen anyone write a replacement for XPath? Nope. It's not like everyone is rushing out to write the next big XML-querying framework. This is because XPath is a language, not a library, and it's orders of magnitude more conceptually scalable than the equivalent DOM manipulations.</blockquote>

<p>Steve Yegge's take on the Java language in the light of Sun's announcement of support for JRuby (Sun hired a couple of lead developers of the JRuby project recently). It is a very interesting read (but it is a bit long; so get yourself some coffee or whatever works for you before starting to read it).</p>
<p>In order to understand as to why Sun is actively supporting JRuby, it is important to look at it from their perspective: the &quot;Java language&quot; is not what matters to Sun, but it is the &quot;Java platform&quot; that is really important to them when it comes to making money.<!-- technorati tags begin --></p>
