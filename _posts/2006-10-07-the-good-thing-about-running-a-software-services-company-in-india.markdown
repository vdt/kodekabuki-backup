<p>This is a very valid point mentioned in the Economist article which talks about the growth of the technology industry in India and China. Running a software/services firm in India is much less of a hassle than running a manufacturing plant because you'll be isolated from all the ill effects of local politics and bureaucracy and this probably appeals to the founders of such startups who are mostly foreign-returned intellectuals.</p>
<p>The single point of failure in your software/services business is ofcourse your network connection to the other side of the globe. But if that is up and running, you can easily avoid a lot of annoyances which other local companies have to face and live with in their day-to-day operations. If you've ever tried importing something into India, you will know how much of effort and how long it takes for the package to arrive at your door after customs clearance at the nearest port.</p>
