<blockquote>
    <p><strong>On SaaS model</strong>: We take advantage of the progress we see in hardware, like what blade servers are doing. What we do is -- <strong>we share the program but we separate the data of the company because we want to help with security and protection</strong>. This is always an issue -- companies don't want to share [their data]. The cost of this approach is only slightly higher than in the software-as-a-service model, but it is much lower than having it on-premise.</p>
    <p><strong>On &quot;push&quot; principle</strong>: To put it differently -- we have the philosophy that in the future people will work differently. <strong>They won't just sit down and have a transaction with a computer.</strong> It will be more of a &quot;push&quot; principle, managed by exceptions -- <strong>so that the application is pushing exceptions to your desk. </strong>For example, in the morning you would have not only email, but also an inbox of all the urgent business issues you should know about -- information which is critical for you to make decisions. This empowers people and brings decision making down to a decentralized level. People can act very quickly, but still -- I come back to this -- within the company's rules. And if you do those things you can reach more users.</p>
    <p><strong>On India</strong>: In China it is the IP [intellectual property] issue. Everybody is saying this, and they're right. In India it is the infrastructure. I was recently in India where I had to give a speech, and I said that<strong> if India believes it can move directly to a knowledge economy and thus skip the industrial economy they are making a big mistake -- because not everything is digital</strong>. And once something is physical -- and people are physical and food is physical -- you need transportation. That is something India has to focus on. Even if they want to be a knowledge economy immediately, there is still physical transportation. That's the only thing I see.</p>
