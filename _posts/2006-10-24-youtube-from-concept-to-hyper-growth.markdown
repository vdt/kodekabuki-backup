<p>I just watched a talk by Jawed Karim (the less known co-founder of YouTube) at Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ACM Conference.</p>
<p>Interesting stuff from his talk:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They struggled really hard to find users in the beginning.</li>
    <li>Marketing 101: Email your friends, try to get some chicks on the site. (both failed!)</li>
    <li>After they raised money from the VC firm, they gave out an iPod nano every day for a long period!</li>
    <li>Final take-away from his talk: <strong>&quot;look out for things which are really difficult to do now and make them easy&quot;</strong>.</li>
</ul>
