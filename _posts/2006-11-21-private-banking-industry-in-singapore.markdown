<blockquote>
    <p>SINGAPORE has added a new twist to the increasingly fierce battle for Asian private banking talent - an informal non-poaching agreement that effectively protects two local banks from aggressive foreign rivals.</p>
    <p>In an effort to capture a share of Asia's newly created wealth, Singapore-based private banks will have to triple the total number of client relationship managers, or personal advisers, from 2000 to 6000 in the next five years, according to the Boston Consulting Group.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20798902-36375,00.html">This article</a> does a pretty good job at capturing the &quot;job scene&quot; on my university's campus and in Singapore in general. Drop by the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/osa/career/">Career Services</a> webpage of <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg">NUS</a> and the entire list is just flooded with the who's who of global banking (apart from all the local Asian banks) each one trying to out-pay the others to grab the good students. Everything is fine if you wanted a career in a bank, otherwise it almost seems like one will have a hard time looking for a job that he/sheÂ  likes.</p>
