<blockquote> <p>After measuring the extent of sun damage on a customer's face, for example, Clarity Pro provides a graph showing the maximum number of minutes the person should spend under the sun, based on daily ultraviolet indexes.  <p>The device also measures areas of unhealthy redness and tabulates how many pores are afflicted by acne-causing bacteria and excessive sebum, an oil the body produces that can promote bacterial growth.  <p>It can even tell in excruciating detail the number of wrinkles on a person's face, as well as the length and depth of each line.  <p>A woman in her 50s who recently underwent a Clarity Pro scan was informed she had 182 wrinkles, 1,262 deeply inflamed pores and a skin-tone evenness score of 17.1, meaning she had some redness or blemishes.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/16106446.htm">MercuryNews.com | 11/27/2006 | Power scanner shines light on skin imperfections</a> </p> <p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:975dcf8d-0cf6-40ef-8a93-1e679aa2e390" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/scanner" rel="tag">scanner</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/skin" rel="tag">skin</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/diagnosis" rel="tag">diagnosis</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/facial" rel="tag">facial</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/UV" rel="tag">UV</a></div></p>
