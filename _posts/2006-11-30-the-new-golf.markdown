<blockquote>All told, at least 10 million people pay $15 and up a month to play these games, and maybe 20 million more log in once in a while. Some players call <i>World of Warcraft</i> "the new golf," as young colleagues and business partners gather online to slay orcs instead of gathering on the green to hack away at little white balls. Says eBay Inc. founder and Chairman Pierre M. Omidyar, whose investing group, Omidyar Network, is a Linden Lab backer: "This generation that grew up on video games is blurring the lines between games and real life."</blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982001.htm">My Virtual Life</a> </p> <p>I couldn't agree more with that claim especially after working&nbsp;at <a title="Bezurk Travel Search" href="http://www.bezurk.com" target="_blank">Bezurk</a> last summer :)</p> <p>Lately I have been thinking about&nbsp;this and it seems to&nbsp;me that these days one's&nbsp;identity in the geek community&nbsp;is established&nbsp;based on his/her&nbsp;unquestionable loyalty&nbsp;to the following 4 things:</p> <ul> <li>Linux  <li>Web 2.0  <li>Apple  <li>WoW</li></ul> <p>While I do score pretty well with the first three things, I suck at the last one. But my feeling is that if I do get myself involved with the last one, then I&nbsp;should be prepared to&nbsp;bid farewell to&nbsp;the "almost&nbsp;non-existent social life" that I have now&nbsp;:)</p> <p>On the same page, Cory Ondrejka (CTO of <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">SecondLife</a>) was in Singapore today.
