<blockquote> <p>Investors trading shares of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/mem/MWredirect.html?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&amp;symb=F">Ford Motor</a> know there are certain events that cause the share price to rise or fall â€” sudden changes in gasoline prices, a labor strike at a parts supplier, a poor month for automobile sales, for example. Reuters NewsScope will allow investors to fine-tune their computers to scan live news feeds of Reuters coverage and watch for items affecting Ford.  <p>Then, through a separate NewsScope program, traders could further adjust trading parameters by scanning Reuters news archives for articles about past announcements from Ford. The database allows traders to analyze how a companyâ€™s stock performed after those announcements and to look at the price and volume of shares traded. Investors would program their computers to buy or sell stock automatically based on historical patterns.  <p>Algorithmic trading, also known as programmed trading, is not a new phenomenon, but it is increasing in popularity. <strong>A third of all stock trades in the United States were driven by automatic algorithms last year, some studies estimate</strong>.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/technology/11reuters.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">From Reuters, Automatic Trading Linked to News Events - New York Times</a> </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:40d081d8-3097-4843-bfa3-f4bbb831be1a" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/stock" rel="tag">stock</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/trade" rel="tag">trade</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/algorithmic" rel="tag">algorithmic</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/trading" rel="tag">trading</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/share" rel="tag">share</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/market" rel="tag">market</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/reuters" rel="tag">reuters</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/AI" rel="tag">AI</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/intelligent" rel="tag">intelligent</a></div>
