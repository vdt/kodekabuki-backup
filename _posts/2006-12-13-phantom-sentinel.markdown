Think of a helicopter: the body is immobile and thus visible, but the blades are moving so fast that the eye sees them as only a vague blur. Tangrenâ€™s device works like a helicopter, except that the whole craft is nothing but the blades. Meanwhile, cameras mounted near the center of the Sentinel whirl in circular patterns, capturing a 360-degree panorama and broadcasting live video to the operators. A Sentinel can be folded up into a backpack and can fly for up to 40 minutes before its batteries need refueling.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section1A.t-8.html">The Boomerang Drone - New York Times</a> </p> <p>Interesting idea; but if you watch the product videos on the manufacturer's website, you can very clearly make out the drone in the sky. And I'm wondering if&nbsp;they have an extremely high-speed camera on-board the device to avoid any blurring effects? And what the hell do they mean by a 360-degree panaroma in this scenario? Isn't a bird's-eye view already good enough?</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:630f25bc-2a04-41d5-89c5-396df34d1f8a" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/boomerang" rel="tag">boomerang</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/drone" rel="tag">drone</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/phantom%20sentinel" rel="tag">phantom sentinel</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/spy" rel="tag">spy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/device" rel="tag">device</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/warfare" rel="tag">warfare</a></div>
