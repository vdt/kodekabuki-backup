<p><a href="http://jeffsutherland.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Sutherland</a> is&nbsp;the co-creator of <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/about/" target="_blank">Scrum</a> and in this lecture&nbsp;he talks about a recent Scrum implementation at Google - Adwords team.</p> <p><embed id="VideoPlayback" style="width: 400px; height: 326px" align="middle" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=8795214308797356840&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars="playerMode=embedded" salign="TL" scale="noScale" bgcolor="#ffffff" quality="best"> </embed></p> <p>I have been sort of reading a lot about Scrum lately. Actually what got me started was&nbsp;an article titled "<a href="http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/ScrumAndXpFromTheTrenches.pdf" target="_blank">Scrum and XP from the Trenches</a>"&nbsp;[pdf] in which a guy from a <a href="http://www.crisp.se/" target="_blank">Swedish software firm</a> talks about&nbsp;their experiences in implementing Scrum at their firm.&nbsp;Actually Jeff does&nbsp;mention in the talk about very high Scrum adoption in Scandinavian firms compared to the rest of the world.  <p>Before you start watching the talk, I recommend that you read a little bit about the Scrum terminologies - what is a sprint backlog? burndown chart? etc etc.&nbsp;Here is <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum" target="_blank">a nice place</a> to start learning about Scrum&nbsp;(and no, Wikipedia does not do a good job at explaining Scrum!).  <p>In the talk, Jeff also claims that he has data to prove that a firm can probably save a&nbsp;significant amount of&nbsp;money by adopting agile methodologies&nbsp;instead of just&nbsp;playing safe&nbsp;by&nbsp;outsourcing&nbsp;the project&nbsp;to a firm in India which most likely just&nbsp;carries out&nbsp;development the ol' waterfall way. I wonder how many companies in Asia are actually doing Scrum/Agile&nbsp;with reasonable&nbsp;success?&nbsp;Do you know&nbsp;a Singaporean software&nbsp;firm which does Agile?  <p>If you want to&nbsp;read more about Scrum and Agile development in general, <a href="http://www.theagileblog.net/" target="_blank">The Agile Blog</a> by Rally folks, and <a href="http://blogs.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank">ThoughtBlogs</a> by ThoughtWorks guys are good blogs to start with. </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:81e1cc3c-3f3e-4c6b-b86d-52151b8f1435" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/google" rel="tag">google</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/scrum" rel="tag">scrum</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/agile" rel="tag">agile</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/software" rel="tag">software</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/project%20management" rel="tag">project management</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/development" rel="tag">development</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/jeff%20sutherland" rel="tag">jeff sutherland</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/waterfall" rel="tag">waterfall</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/implementation" rel="tag">implementation</a></div>
