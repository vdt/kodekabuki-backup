<blockquote> <p><i>For years, developers have complained about designer-focused concepts in Flash like the timeline. Is Flex Builder deliberately a change from that?</i>  <p>Thatâ€™s why I quit Microsoft and went to Macromedia - the <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flash/8/main/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=LiveDocs_Parts&amp;file=00004974.html">timeline</a>! I'm a developer and for me there were dual realities. <strong>I would see amazing stuff done in Flash and then I would pick up the tool and literally every concept you have is wrong! I want a data grid, I want a tab - how is that a movie clip?</strong> That was the potential I saw in Flash and in some ways it was similar to ASP. With ASP, Scott Guthrie and I were looking at how people built Web apps and at the hoops they were jumping through. We looked at Visual Interdev 6 and the gobbledegook it was spitting out and we thought there has to be a better way.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/12/15/mark_anders_flash/">Mark Anders on Flash development | The Register</a> </p> <p>Apparently Adobe's Flex has been built by ex-Microsofties - a welcome change for people like me! No more timelines! No more of calling your app a movie! But&nbsp;I wonder who is going to take the risk of developing apps in Flex which is dependent on Adobe's Flash player v9.0. It will be quite&nbsp;a while before everyone updates their Flash players. Flex is actually the reason why I think Adobe is <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/">showing new interest</a> in quickly getting their Linux version out (so much for all that talk about cross-platform technology!).</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:86747c98-5f82-420d-9ecc-2a1936c0a301" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/adobe" rel="tag">adobe</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/flex" rel="tag">flex</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/flash" rel="tag">flash</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/development" rel="tag">development</a></div>
