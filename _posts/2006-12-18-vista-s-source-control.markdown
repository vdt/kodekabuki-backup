<blockquote> <p>I'd also like to sketch out how actual coding works on the Windows team.<br></p> <p>In small programming projects, there's a central repository of code. Builds are produced, generally daily, from this central repository. Programmers add their changes to this central repository as they go, so the daily build is a pretty good snapshot of the current state of the product.</p> <p><br>In Windows, this model breaks down simply because there are far too many developers to access one central repository. <strong>So Windows has a tree of repositories: developers check in to the nodes, and periodically the changes in the nodes are integrated up one level in the hierarchy. At a different periodicity, changes are integrated down the tree from the root to the nodes.</strong> In Windows, the node I was working on was 4 levels removed from the root. The periodicity of integration decayed exponentially and unpredictably as you approached the root so it ended up that <strong>it took between 1 and 3 months for my code to get to the root node, and some multiple of that for it to reach the other nodes</strong>. It should be noted too that the only common ancestor that my team, the shell team, and the kernel team shared was the root.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://moishelettvin.blogspot.com/2006/11/windows-shutdown-crapfest.html">moblog: The Windows Shutdown crapfest</a> </p> <p>I have heard about the daily build process of Vista&nbsp;before in Channel 9 videos too - they actually burn like hundreds of DVDs of every build and place them at different places in their campus for their employees to pick up and try the latest build. It's surprising that with this much of complexity some one can actually ship a product!</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:f6114563-bdaa-42a8-a3d1-9cc5d6ac1f4d" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/source%20control" rel="tag">source control</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/windows" rel="tag">windows</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/vista" rel="tag">vista</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/microsoft" rel="tag">microsoft</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/daily" rel="tag">daily</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/build" rel="tag">build</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/software" rel="tag">software</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/shipping" rel="tag">shipping</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/repository" rel="tag">repository</a></div>
