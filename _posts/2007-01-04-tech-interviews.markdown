<p>I just couldn't stop laughing after reading the following from a Joel Spolsky article. He mentions about the two kinds of geeks that you'll find often:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html">People who are <strong>Smart but donâ€™t Get Things Done</strong> often have PhDs and work in big companies where nobody listens to them because they are completely impractical. They would rather mull over something academic about a problem rather than ship on time. These kind of people can be identified because they love to point out the theoretical similarity between two widely divergent concepts. For example, they will say, â€œ<strong>Spreadsheets are really just a special case of programming language</strong>,â€ and then go off for a week and write a thrilling, brilliant whitepaper about the theoretical computational linguistic attributes of a spreadsheet as a programming language. Smart, but not useful. The other way to identify these people is that they have a tendency to show up at your office, <strong>coffee mug in hand, and try to start a long conversation about the relative merits of Java introspection vs. COM type libraries, on the day you are trying to ship a beta.</strong><br/>
<p><strong>People who Get Things Done but are not Smart</strong> will do stupid things, seemingly without thinking about them, and somebody else will have to come clean up their mess later. This makes them net liabilities to the company because not only do they fail to contribute, but they soak up good peopleâ€™s time. <strong>They are the kind of people who decide to refactor your core algorithms to use the Visitor Pattern, which they just read about the night before</strong>, and completely misunderstood, and instead of simple loops adding up items in an array youâ€™ve got an AdderVistior class (yes, itâ€™s spelled wrong) and a VisitationArrangingOfficer singleton and none of your code works any more.</p>
