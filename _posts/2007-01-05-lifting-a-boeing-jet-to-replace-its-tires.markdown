<p>I was watching Discovery and they were showing how they replace the tires on a Boeing jumbo jet. One of the cool things is you would assume that you need some super-strong mega jack to lift the aircraft. But apparently a simple hydraulic lift is enough to do the job. And most importantly, they use a clever trick here:</p>

<p>The input force that they have to apply is actually obtained by just diverting the air from the tire that they want to remove into the hydraulic lift. Ofcourse I assume this would not work if the tire was completely flat but then again (atleast from the video) it looks like they do routine maintainance checks on all the tires by removing them after every landing or so.<br/>
