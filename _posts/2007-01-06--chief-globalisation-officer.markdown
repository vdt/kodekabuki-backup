<p>Apparently&nbsp;that's a real job title at Cisco! And guess where does that person work? In Bangalore. I just loved the reaction from one of their family members&nbsp;when this person decided to take the job :)&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>"My mother-in-law said to my wife, <strong>'What did you do to deserve this?</strong>'" said Elfrink, who was scheduled to depart Sunday for a luxury home he's leasing in the southern Indian tech hub. "I just tell people that I want to be where the innovation is." </p></blockquote> <p>But seriously Bangalore is not such a bad place to stay especially if you're getting paid (really) well. Just one piece of advice&nbsp;- do not register a first impression of Bangalore just from that airport. Even we know that the existing airport stinks by any third-world standards. But the new one is on its way (scheduled for <a href="http://www.karnataka.com/watch/blr-airport/">opening in 2008</a>). Also illustrates true globalisation means "migration in either directions".</p> <blockquote> <p>His goal: <strong>3,000 employees by mid-2008, including about 15 vice presidents, 60 directors and 300 managers. </strong></p> <p>"It will give them some exposure and it's a glamorous job ... but <strong>it could create an Ivy League-type clique of expats who are richer than the locals," Kay said. "I doubt that most of them will stay long enough to learn a language beyond ordering food and beer</strong>. They're not 'going native' and getting deep expertise in the Indian market." </p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8MFUV1G0.htm">Cisco shifts executives to India</a> </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:14bc279d-c440-4cdc-9fa9-000a977acaea" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/globalisation" rel="tag">globalisation</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/india" rel="tag">india</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/bangalore" rel="tag">bangalore</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/world%20is%20flat" rel="tag">world is flat</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/cisco" rel="tag">cisco</a></div>
