<p>I always wondered how&nbsp;Zennstrom and Friis managed to use the same P2P technology for&nbsp;their Venice project after having sold Skype to eBay. Apparently they still own the core P2P technology under the name Joltid, and Skype&nbsp;still licenses it from that company. &nbsp;</p> <blockquote><a>After Zennstrom left to work full time as the CEO of Skype, de Wahl took over as the chief executive of JoltId, the company that controls the peer-to-peer technology that powers not only Kazaa, but also Skype and now The Venice Project. â€œSkype licenses the P2P technology from Joltid,â€ de Wahl says.</a></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://newteevee.com/2007/01/11/venice-project-mozilla/">NewTeeVee Â» Exclusive: Inside The Venice Project, Built On Mozilla</a> </p> <p>I got a beta invite for the Venice Project. The Venice player is really good - live streaming required something like 600 Kbps and worked without any glitches. But currently it does not have any good content. As mentioned in the above article, it happens to be built from Mozilla.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:19d523b9-bc0d-426d-9d5b-de38a1173881" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/skype" rel="tag">skype</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/venice%20project" rel="tag">venice project</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/p2p" rel="tag">p2p</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/zennstorm" rel="tag">zennstorm</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/friis" rel="tag">friis</a></div>
