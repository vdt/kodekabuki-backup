<p>The first BarCamp Singapore happened at NTUC Centre on Saturday.&nbsp;A sizeable no. of people turned up&nbsp;(my estimate is 30-35 people). </p> <p>A lot of credit should go to <a href="http://chandrashekar.beingalpha.com/">Chandra</a>, <a href="http://www.mingyeow.com/">Ming Yeow</a> and others who organised the event, secured a good venue, and got sponsorships for the cool&nbsp;t-shirts (from Yahoo!)&nbsp;and the pizzas (from IDA).&nbsp;</p> <p>Things that I feel should be changed in the next BarCamp:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Presentation slots should be made shorter</strong>.&nbsp;45 mins ==&gt;&nbsp;15-30 mins max. </li> <li><strong>Presentations should be strictly timed</strong>. Some talks in the Tech section got dragged.</li> <li>Important: <strong>Everyone should be made to present in the future in the original&nbsp;BarCamp fashion</strong>. No seriously, I'm really sure that everyone has something valuable to contribute. People are generally lazy :)<br><br>If people don't want to do long talks, a special section can be arranged for "lightning talks" (10-15 mins each)&nbsp;in the end. I have seen this format&nbsp;really work well&nbsp;at a lot of OpenSource conferences. People plug in their laptop, quickly say who they are, what they are going to talk about, what they've been hacking/working on, and finally one or two questions from the audience&nbsp;and then the end (whether they finished or not). If there are lots of questions, there are normally&nbsp;other avenues for networking&nbsp;after the BarCamp. Typically people hang out somewhere in the evening (go for drinks).</li></ul> <p>Things that I would like to change (but don't know how):</p> <p><strong>The lack of geeks (and general interest in tech topics)</strong></p> <p>The tech section only had around 5-7 people. Apart from me, it was (more or less)&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.codefront.net/">Chu Yeow</a>, <a href="http://blog.yanime.org/">Choon Keat</a>, Shyam (Gentoo volunteer)&nbsp;who gave a talk on Nagios, Deepan Chakravarthy, Michael (<a href="http://www.petrolwatch.com.sg/">PetrolWatch</a>) and a couple of others whose names I can't recollect right now (sorry!). Deepan who is originally from Bangalore mentioned to me that he was also fairly disappointed with the general geek numbers in Singapore having attended the BarCamps in Bangalore where the geek audience turnout is in the order of 500. While I understand that&nbsp;Bangalore is a bigger city (15 million)&nbsp;and the IT back-office of the world, I would still say that things&nbsp;can be a lot better in Singapore. </p> <p>Just to provide an idea of the kind of audience we had, I'm cooking up the following numbers based on what&nbsp;I saw.</p> <p>People who attended BarCamp Sg...</p> <ul> <li>Have heard of AJAX: 99% ?</li> <li>Read TechCrunch: 75% ?</li> <li>Have written code before: 65% ?</li> <li>Know which port a web server runs on (normally): 55% ?</li> <li>Used a *nix machine: 35% ?</li> <li>Know the difference between static and dynamic typing: 30% ?</li> <li>Have built a mashup: 15% ?</li> <li>Know a functional language: &nbsp;10% ?</li> <li>Can say what a "closure" is: 10% ?</li> <li>Contributed to Open Source: &lt; 5% ?</li> <li>Can churn out a working Ruby interpreter in Haskell by the time the talk is over: 0.000000000001% ? :)</li></ul> <p>While I do find a lot of people in Singapore who have heard about Web 2.0, AJAX,&nbsp;news from the Valley, mashups, etc, there's a serious lack of&nbsp;uber-cool geeks here. While I don't expect to meet a <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/">Joe Hewitt</a> in Singapore (just as yet),&nbsp;there should be more geeks here if people want to see great innovation. Just&nbsp;administrative efficiency or&nbsp;corruption-free agencies or&nbsp;Govt. laid "paths to innovation" are not going to cut it in my opinion. If you want to build the next great software startup out of Singapore, then there should be some freakin' cool geeks here. Just ideas, or money or good marketing/PR, or govt pushing is not going to do it. If you agree or don't agree, I would like to hear from you. Please do comment.</p> <p>Ok you might say that&nbsp;I'm heavily biased because of what I am. But this is my opinion (after&nbsp;observing for more than 3 years now) and a blog is meant for expressing one's opinions&nbsp;whether they might be right or wrong&nbsp;:-)</p> <p><strong>Slides</strong></p> <p>S5 slides from my talk licensed under Creative-Commons&nbsp;- "<a title="Django: indenting jazz for the web" href="http://poundbang.in/barcampsg/slides.html" target="_blank">Django: indenting jazz for the web</a>".
