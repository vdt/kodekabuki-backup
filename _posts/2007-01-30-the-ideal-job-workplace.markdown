<p>A lot of people have been asking me about my ideal job lately. Most of them don't understand why pay is not the only factor that matters to a good software engineer. So here it is:</p> <ul> <li>position requires writing <strong>lot of code</strong>.  <li>firm's <strong>core business is writing software</strong>.  <li>preferably a small development&nbsp;team in a <strong>startup-like environment</strong>.  <li><strong>people are&nbsp;passionate</strong> about the product/service they're building (not doing it just to make a living).  <li>lot of <strong>importance and thought is given to the software development process</strong> -&nbsp;good testing/QA, continous builds, use of good&nbsp;bug reporting&nbsp;tools,&nbsp;version control&nbsp;systems, agile methods, etc.&nbsp;No need to be "buzzword-compliant" but&nbsp;yet&nbsp;open to adopting&nbsp;new and&nbsp;better practices.  <li>the&nbsp;<strong>person that I report to</strong> should preferably also have a CS degree&nbsp;and <strong>writes some&nbsp;code</strong>.  <li><strong>meetings</strong> are really quick, ad-hoc, and should serve a purpose; preferably meetings are called for by doing a quick shout-out to the developers, assembling in front of a whiteboard, discussing, and getting done with it quickly without wasting time.  <li><strong>dual LCDs</strong> (the larger, the better!)&nbsp;+ fast computers for developers.&nbsp;  <li>unlimited <strong>supply of drinks &amp; snacks</strong> (ofcourse free lunch would be great&nbsp;as long as the company has Google-like cashflows).  <li>turning up <strong>before 9:30 AM is not required</strong> every day.  <li>high-speed <strong>internet access</strong>&nbsp;at work (and no blocking reddit!).  <li>staying up really late and occasional&nbsp;visits during the weekend are allowed; would also love&nbsp;some <strong>crazy all-niters&nbsp;&amp; sleeping&nbsp;bag</strong> nites&nbsp;once in a while :)  <li>contributing to <strong>OpenSource</strong> is encouraged in the workplace.  <li>attending&nbsp;<strong>geek conferences</strong> (PyCON, MacWorld, GUADEC, BarCamps, etc)&nbsp;is not frowned upon. Ofcourse I promise not to run away during crunch time!  <li><strong>no formal dresscode</strong>; common sense prevails - I won't turn up wearing shorts when we have to meet some customers.  <li>and&nbsp;finally&nbsp;<strong>decent pay</strong>.</li></ul> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:ddfbdc9e-4198-41c2-a8c6-200606fd3da8" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/ideal%20job" rel="tag">ideal job</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/career" rel="tag">career</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/software%20engineer" rel="tag">software engineer</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/workplace" rel="tag">workplace</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/startup" rel="tag">startup</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/job" rel="tag">job</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/software" rel="tag">software</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/developer" rel="tag">developer</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/singapore" rel="tag">singapore</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/work%20culture" rel="tag">work culture</a></div>
