<blockquote> <p><strong>Lightroom is 40% Lua. How did you select Lua? Which parts of the program are handled by Lua?</strong>  <p><strong>MH:</strong> I foisted Lua on the rest of the team which actually at that point was very small. But I had discovered it just in reading some of the mailing lists I was onâ€”I think it was actually a garbage collection mailing list that led me to it.  <p>I wanted to build an app that was heavily scriptable and was looking for a good scripting language to build in and got the pointer to Lua. Iâ€™d actually read one of the first papers on Lua several years earlier but hadnâ€™t pursued it because it hadnâ€™t been relevant to what I was doing. At that point Lua was also much more primitive than it was when we picked it up.  <p>Lua has an appealing balance of simplicity and power. Itâ€™s small, fast, and easy to embed. It also has a very straightforward license associated with it. Itâ€™s very much like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/264uux--another">Scheme</a> language I likeâ€”but without a syntax likely to make people go running for the hills. So there were a lot of things.  <p>I looked at some other things. I looked at JavaScript: Adobe had an internal implementation of JavaScript but it wasnâ€™t as easy to do drop-ins and all the things we wanted to do in the Lightroom project. I looked at Python, I looked at Ruby. Some things were going to be bigger, slower, and had licenses that were harder to figure out. Lua just happened to fit really well.  <p>So what we do with Lua is essentially all of the application logic from running the UI to managing what we actually do in the database. Pretty much every piece of code in the app that could be described as making decisions or implementing features is in Lua until you get down to the raw processing, which is in C++. The database engine is in C; the interface to the OS is in C++ and Objective C as appropriate to platform. But most of the actually interesting material in the app beyond the core database code (which is <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>) and the raw processing code (which is essentially <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html">Adobe Camera Raw</a>) is all in Lua.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://since1968.com/article/190/mark-hamburg-interview-adobe-photoshop-lightroom-part-2-of-2">since1968.com: Mark Hamburg Interview: Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Part 2 of 2</a> </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:cda11a6a-bbc1-481c-adf1-3ae8d35f8272" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/lua" rel="tag">lua</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/adobe" rel="tag">adobe</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/photoshop" rel="tag">photoshop</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/extensions" rel="tag">extensions</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/interview" rel="tag">interview</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/lightroom" rel="tag">lightroom</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/software" rel="tag">software</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/scripting" rel="tag">scripting</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/developers" rel="tag">developers</a></div>
