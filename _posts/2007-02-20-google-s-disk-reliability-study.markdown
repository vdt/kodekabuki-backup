<p>If you hang around at the right places on the web, you would have heard about <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/disk_failures.pdf">Google's disk reliability survey</a> which they published as a paper recently. Actually I didn't know much about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis,_and_Reporting_Technology">S.M.A.R.T</a> parameters for disk drives until I read that paper (though it strikes me now that I have seen the word S.M.A.R.T a lot of times during initial bootup). </p>

<p>Anyways I downloaded a freeware utility called HDTune and ran it on my laptop (which has a Samsung hard drive). <br/>

<p>I ran this benchmark and it reports back to me the average transfer rate (read) and the access time. I ran it multiple times but what is weird is the performance always worsened as the test progressed (see the dip in the blue line). The <a href="http://www.hdtune.com/">HDTune website</a> actually says that this is what you should expect but doesn't state the reason for it. Any ideas?<br/>

<p>The ones above are the various S.M.A.R.T parameters.<br/>
