<p><a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~echi/">Ed H. Chi</a> of Xerox Parc has published an interesting <a href="http://www.viktoria.se/altchi/submissions/submission_edchi_0.pdf">paper</a> [pdf] about the efficiency of the tagging system built into <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. The way he does that is to&nbsp;measure entropy (yup that same old same old Claude Shannon's information theory which you learned in one of the CS courses) of entities like documents (D), users (U)&nbsp;and tags (T). His research group crawled the entire del.icio.us archive and then calculated the entropies. Here's what they found:</p> <blockquote> <p>â€¢ H(D|T) specifies the social navigation efficiency. How efficient is it for us to specify a set of tags to find a set of specific documents? <strong>We found that in del.icio.us that it is getting less and less efficient</strong>.<br><br>â€¢ H(T|D) specifies the social tagging efficiency. How efficient is a set of tags to describe a set of documents? In our context, how efficient is it for taggers to specify a set of tags to describe a set of documents? In del.icio.us, <strong>social tagging is getting less efficient</strong>.<br><br>â€¢ H(D|U) specifies the document recommendation efficiency. How easy is it for us to specify a set of documents for a set of users? We found that this measure hit a plateau, and that<strong> it is getting neither harder nor easier to recommend documents to users</strong>. This is also a measure of the degrees of overlaps of documents visited between users.<br><br>â€¢ H(T|U) specifies the user modeling efficiency. How easy is it to identify a set of tags (which specifies the topics) given a set of users? We found that it is <strong>getting slightly harder to find topic experts in del.icio.us</strong>, perhaps because more information diffusion is happening. Users are using a more diverse set of tags over time, which was independently verified by Golder and Huberman.<br><br>â€¢ H(U|D) and H(U|T) specifies the topic and document expertise efficiency. How easy is it for us to find a group of users, given we know either a set of documents or tags? We found <strong>finding user expertise is becoming more and more difficult</strong>. </p></blockquote> <p>Ed Chi gave a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3491597281548199656&amp;q=engedu">talk</a> at Google on various topics related to social search and his other&nbsp;works. The first part of the talk is focused mostly on Wikipedia. The last 15% of the talk or so is about&nbsp;the del.icio.us tagging. </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:425c7ea0-73c3-4efa-9725-21ab55d50147" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/entropy" rel="tag">entropy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/folksonomy" rel="tag">folksonomy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/tagging" rel="tag">tagging</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/delicious" rel="tag">delicious</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/del.icio.us" rel="tag">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/cs" rel="tag">cs</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/research" rel="tag">research</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/xerox" rel="tag">xerox</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/parc" rel="tag">parc</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/information%20theory" rel="tag">information theory</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/shannon" rel="tag">shannon</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/claude%20shannon" rel="tag">claude shannon</a></div>
