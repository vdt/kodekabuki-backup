Why all the excitement in the Singaporean web2.0 community today? <a href="http://www.velvetpuffin.com">VelvetPuffin</a> became the first Singaporean company to make it to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a>. VelvetPuffin is a service launched by Radixs, a startup funded by EDB Singapore (<a href="http://www.bjornlee.com/2007/03/05/velvet-puffin-singapores-very-own-myspace/">around $10 million</a>). I heard about Radixs long time back when they presented at DemoMobile 2003. </p>

<p><strong>What does Radixs do?</strong> Radixs figured out a way to distribute full-blown desktop apps on-demand to any mobile phone which is running their MXI OS (as they call it). The applications are normal desktop apps written for any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). According to some news reports, they launched a trial here in Singapore with Singtel in which they offered Sun's StarOffice as an on-demand software solution to the mobile phones.</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> Frankly <strong>I do not have an idea</strong>. But I will try to make a good guess here. I think the way it works is similar to how a unix X11 system works. With an X server/client combo on unix, you can easily channel the display from one terminal to any other terminal over the network and use it just like you're sitting infront of that machine. Basically the X11 client's responsibility is to send input from the local keyboard/mouse over to the Xserver and similarly receive the display out from the Xserver and show it on the local monitor. <br/>
</p>

<p>Now this is a pretty simple thing to do as long as a number of things are right - importantly screen resolutions should not change drastically between the two terminals and there should be sufficient bandwidth between the two terminals. Actually I think if you own a PDA running Linux (reminds me of those Sharp Zaurus PDAs), you can try something like this over WiFi right now and my gut feeling is you can get it working with a little bit of hacking.</p>

<p>But my question is "<strong>does this technology make sense anymore?</strong>". What they're achieving by relaying desktop apps over the network is basically avoiding a lot of computation on the phone and <strong>use it more like a dumb thin client.</strong> But IMO these days, the <strong>bottleneck is not the computing power</strong> on the phone but t<strong>he ridiculously high data exchange rates</strong> which mobile carriers charge. If you think about it, Apple placed a desktop-class version of OS X inside the iPhone and managed to pull off sufficient battery life inspite of all that computation overhead. So I do not see how Radixs' solution is aligned properly in a scenario like this. But I could be wrong here since I have taken the liberty of doing a lot of guess work.<br/>
</p>

<p>Also more importantly <strong>instead of selling this core "desktop-phone remoting" technology (I think that's what they were trying to do until now!) why did they launch a social networking service out of the blue?</strong><br/>
