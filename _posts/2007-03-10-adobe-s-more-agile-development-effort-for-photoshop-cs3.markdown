<blockquote> <p><strong>Did it change the way you put out betas?</strong>  <p>An automatic process builds the program every night and runs a set of tests before posting the build on our internal servers for QE to test. We could take almost any of those daily builds and use them for demos.  <p>The public beta was basically just "whatever build is ready on date X". There were only a couple of "we really gotta fix <em>this</em> before we send out the public beta" bugs. With past versions, we couldn't have done a public beta at all that far ahead of release - there would have been far too many bugs.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2007/03/08/adobe_cs3_development/">Adobe edits the development cycle | Reg Developer</a> </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b39b072d-e7b2-4df3-ab13-635cb3674e84" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/adobe" rel="tag">adobe</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/software%20development" rel="tag">software development</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/interview" rel="tag">interview</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/agile" rel="tag">agile</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/sdlc" rel="tag">sdlc</a></div>
