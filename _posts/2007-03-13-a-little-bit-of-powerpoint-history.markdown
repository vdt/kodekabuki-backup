<blockquote>PowerPoint was further developed by Bob Gaskins, BNR's head of computer-science research, who took the idea to Forethought, who released the first version in black and white for the Macintosh only in 1987. Not long afterwards, the company was purchased by Microsoft for $14 million, and PowerPoint for Windows was released in 1990. PowerPoint spread like the plague, and the rest, as they say, is history.</blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://www.itpro.co.uk/blogs/editorial-blogs/richard-hillesley/14663/a-pig-through-the-python.thtml">ITPRO</a></p>
