I just found this useful comment which lists down the options for an Indian student in the US if he/she wanted to start-up. Some discussion is going on about Visa problems for foreigners if they wanted to participate in YCombinator's summer program.  <blockquote> <p>I'm indian, I'm about to graduate with a phd, and I have a job offer. My options for starting a startup:  <p>0. Go back to india. This has a certain allure, but I need to start from scratch on figuring out contacts for investment. Odds of finding a deal like YC are slim.  <p>1. Work on the startup in the year of my OPT, hope to arrange a visa in a year.  <p>2. Put off the startup for a year or so, and try to transfer my H-1 to a startup. This is easier than applying for an H-1 from scratch, but it's not clear how much easier it is, and what the other constraints are.  <p>3. Put off the startup for a few years (unbounded) until my green card. Needless to say, this option has the stench of death to it.  <p>These are my options as I see them. Am I missing something? Comments much appreciated, especially on option 2. It's been hard to even find a lawyer in Texas; everyone seems do be doing corporate H-1Bs right now.</p></blockquote> <p>Source: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=4408">Y Combinator: Discussion</a> </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:09c75669-5106-407c-8a7d-ee8706eaac99" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/india" rel="tag">india</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/student" rel="tag">student</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/US" rel="tag">US</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/america" rel="tag">america</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/startup" rel="tag">startup</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/visa" rel="tag">visa</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/h1b" rel="tag">h1b</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/immigration" rel="tag">immigration</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/entrepreneurism" rel="tag">entrepreneurism</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/ycombinator" rel="tag">ycombinator</a></div>
