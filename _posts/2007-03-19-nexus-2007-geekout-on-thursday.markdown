I'll be going to Nexus 2007 GeekOut happening on this Thursday at the NTUC centre. Nat Torkington and Andreas Weigend will be present. A bunch of interesting Singapore startups will be demoing their products (including Muvee's Schwup). For more info, visit the <a href="http://nexus2007.wikispaces.com/geekout">event wiki</a>. If you want to come, just sign up on the wiki page! Needless to say, it is free!

If you've already signed up for the Nexus 2007 conference (to be held on Saturday at the same place), don't get confused. This is a separate event.
