Nexus 2007 just concluded! The event was really awesome. Although some of the sessions didn't particularly interest me much, I really loved the rest of the event especially the panel on "the future of the web" (panelists: Andreas Weigend, Bobby Napiltonia of <a href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, Reza Behnam of Yahoo and Nat Torkington of OReilly) and another panel on global startups titled "Riding on Disruptive Change" (panelists: Farzad Naimi of <a href="http://www.litescape.com/">LiteScape</a>, Cory Ondrejka of <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">SecondLife</a> and Roberto Mariani of <a href="http://www.xidtech.com/">XiD Technologies</a>). <br/>
<p>Also met lots and lots of new people and had a chance to talk to <strong>Nat Torkington</strong> of <strong>OReilly Radar</strong> about the <strong>semantic web</strong> (do check out his <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/the_future_of_w_1.html">funny blog post from yesterday</a> in which he tries to predict the future of the web). He was very optimistic of the semantic web working really well within niche domains (and in fact mentioned a couple of startups in the Valley which are using the Semantic Web stuff in really specific domains) but wasn't really excited about the idea of a whole universal semantic web which encompasses all the knowledge of the world. Then as it is inevitable, discussion went on to Perl vs. Python :-)</p>

<p>Also had the chance to talk to Cory for a short while (the really cool part was the schwag - he had a few SecondLife branded thumb drives with SL client's source code on them and I got one!). What is really suprising is how <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo</a> cards have become the new business cards. I recently ordered <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harish_mallipeddi/394223400/">mine</a> and luckily received them right on time for Nexus! Moo cards rock totally! You should try them too.<br/>

<p>Even though there was free wifi available, I didn't manage to get connected (the wireless network was getting clogged all the time). But those who did manage to get online, were invited to participate in live chatting on <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> throughout all the seesions and the audience could see whatever was happening in the chatroom on one of the screens.  Giving the audience complete freedom to interact and express views realtime was a pretty interesting idea (lot of good came out of it but there was ofcourse some amount of irrelevant and off-topic stuff which was going on in the chat room).<br/>
