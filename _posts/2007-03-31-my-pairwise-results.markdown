<p>I tried Pairwise after reading Justin's post. Anyways here's what Pairwise thinks about me vs. typical YCombinator founder. It got a few things surprisingly correct but made some mistakes. Still very impressive considering all that I did was to spend a couple of minutes picking some pictures.<br/>
</p>

<p>Very accurate: <br/>
</p>

<ul>
<li>extremely high interest in tech</li>
<li>decision-making process is predominantly based on logic (omg I don't know how it figured out this!)</li>
<li>humility:intelligence (well I'm above the YC average, so I won't complain :)</li>
<li>not very emotional (ya everyone knows this bit about me)</li>
<li>hate pets (this one is 100% accurate)</li>
<li>pretty clean</li>
<li>mostly plan things out ahead</li>
<li>apparently very masculine (I don't really know what this means and I'm really too masculine compared to avg YC crowd and I wonder why?)</li>
<li>verability: mostly listening (well again 100% right)</li>
<li>smoker: don't smoke (and don't particularly like smokers too!)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>more/less accurate: <br/>
</p>

<ul>
<li>slightly fearless</li>
<li>risk aversion: neutral</li>
<li>humor: sarcastic: don't enjoy much</li>
<li>ain't much into books (but I do read a lot of CS books! I guess those are considered manuals :)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>wrong: <br/>
</p>

<ul>
<li>urbanity: rural? (hey I've been living in big cities all my life and I love city life!)</li>
<li>exercise level : regularly (hehe...damn it would be good if this was true, but honestly I should be placed on the other extreme!)</li>
<li>body clock: day person? (again wrong! I'm a night person)</li>
</ul>
