<p>Inc Magazine published a really interesting <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070401/features-my-awakening.html">article</a> on eSys Technologies founded by Vikas Goel (in picture). He is originally from India but started his company in Singapore. A few interesting things from the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>With his cost of goods sold running at 97 percent of sales, he had to cover all his expenses--sales and marketing, engineering, G&amp;A, the works--<strong>out of the meager 3 percent left over</strong>. Yet, even so, the company had been profitable every year. Its net pretax margin was less than 1 percent, but the fact that <strong>eSys had net profit at all was incredible</strong>.</p>

</blockquote><p><strong>Financing for eSys (this is the part which is really interesting!):</strong><br/>
</p>

<blockquote><p>What really bowled me over, though, was the way Goel had financed the business. He began with the observation that <strong>vendor credit is the cheapest financing money can buy</strong>: It costs nothing. In contrast, bank credit comes with an annual interest expense of about 6 percent and long-term credit costs about 8 percent. Equity is the most expensive capital, since  investors usually expect compounded annual returns of 20 percent or more. Clearly <strong>vendor credit is the way to go, provided you can get it</strong>. One way is to demonstrate through your performance that you have the potential to become a very large and reliable customer. Goel did that and then went a crucial step further. He realized he could <strong>make vendors and lenders even more comfortable about extending credit by buying insurance on whatever the company owed them and making them the  beneficiaries</strong>. This gave eSys access to additional capital at a fraction of the usual cost--the equivalent of about 2 percent annual interest.</p>

</blockquote><p><strong>Why Singapore?</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>It handled finances out of <strong>Singapore, which has the lowest effective tax rate</strong> in the world--below even that of Hong Kong and Ireland. For credit insurance, it went to Switzerland and Germany, where it could get the best rates. It set up IT services and back-office operations in India.</p>

</blockquote><p>What the article doesn't mention is who are his major customers? If his computers are so good and cheap, then why would anyone buy Dell instead of eSys? (On a sidenote, eSys PCs seem to ship with Linux pre-installed!).<br/>
