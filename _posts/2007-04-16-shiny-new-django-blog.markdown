<p>I wrote a blog application in Django over the weekend and imported all my old Wordpress posts into it. So that's one less PHP app I have to deal with :)</p>

<p>Since I'm using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>, you don't have to change anything if you normally read this blog via a feed reader. But do <a href="http://poundbang.in">drop by</a>!</p>
