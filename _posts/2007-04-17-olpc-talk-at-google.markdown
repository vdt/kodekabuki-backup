<p>One of the OLPC engineers gave a talk at Google recently. If you love Linux and Python, you must <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4285568518538296189&amp;q=engedu">watch this one</a>! Though I'm still skeptic about the need for a laptop for studying in a school (mainly because I never used computers for education until I joined university in Singapore; my family did own a PC but it was mostly for games, internet and a bit of programming), but I'm convinced that they are doing some pretty cool work with the laptop - mesh networking, really really advanced power management! </p>

<p>In fact they should just bring some of this technology to commercial laptops! Seriously with that kinda of battery life, the laptop will be really useful to someone like my dad. All my dad ever does with his laptop is email, browse websites, view/create MS Office documents and PDFs. Now you can do all these activities on a OLPC. The only thing that is missing is support for peripherals since it is running Linux underneath (printers, webcams, scanners will be a problem). But think about not having to worry about charging your laptop for an entire business trip! <br />
