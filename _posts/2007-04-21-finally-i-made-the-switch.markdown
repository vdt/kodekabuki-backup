<p>Ok I just bought a MacBook! This would be my first piece of Apple hardware (if you ignore the iMac G3 which I bought from LUGS for S$60 and ran Ubuntu on it for like an year). First of all I should thank my dad for paying for it all!</p>

<p>If you're an expert Mac user, I seek your help - can you point me to good blogs on Mac stuff? (freeware, enhancements, keyboard shortcuts, other tricks!). Apple for some reason installed 17GB worth of software by default (I don't understand how they managed to fill up so much space! It is probably due to stuff like GarageBand, MS Office Trial, etc). </p>
