<p>
This is probably the only time I have seen someone demo their programming language by making phone calls to each other. It is fun! Watch it.</p>

<p>I didn't really know much about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_programming_language">Erlang</a> until now. I went on exchange to the same dept. at <a href="http://www.it.uu.se">Uppsala Univ</a> where a high-performance native code compiler for Erlang is being developed. Had I known about it back then, I could have taken one of their courses.
