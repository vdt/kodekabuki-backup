<p>Chris Shiflett more or less <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2006/feb/top-x-list-of-mac-os-x-annoyances">nailed this one</a>. But here's how I would re-order them and I've a few of my own to add to the list:<br/>
<ul>
   <li>The separated menubar is just driving me crazy! Especially with two screens, the menubar for a window on one screen is still left sitting on the other screen. WTF is that??</li>
    <li>Apps Don't Really Close When You Close Them</li>
    <li>Maximizing Is Broken</li>
    <li>Too Many Option Keys --> No Dedicated Page Up, Page Down, Home, or End Keys. Seriously why do you need both a Ctrl key and a Apple/Cmnd key?</li>
    <li>No "Always On Top" Feature For Windows</li>
    <li>Window resizing: Windows can't be resized from all sides and corners. Only the bottom-right corner!</li>
    <li>Hey Apple, where's my Backspace key?</li>
    <li>Can't delete files and folders in Finder by pressing delete key. I have to drag n' drop to Trash or right-click and do Move To Trash</li>
    <li>The Lack Of Multiple Desktops</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Sadly I realize that neither is the Mac OS X desktop perfect. In fact it has many more minor quirks than Linux. Or maybe I just had high expectations. But some things ofcourse work really well in OS X:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Setting up dual screens took 10 seconds exactly. On Ubuntu, I spent months to get the xorg.conf right!</li>
    <li>OS X implementation of sleep/wake is simply brilliant. Finally I can treat my laptop like a true portable computer and not a miniaturized desktop.</li>
     <li>Bluetooth and wireless work well - but nothing great. I would kinda expect that since I paid for the software.</li>
     <li>Dragging and dropping apps into Applications folder is cool - but certainly not as cool as "apt-get".</li>
     <li>Apple seems to have nice documentation and helpful articles online. Whenever I google for something, atleast one neat article from Apple shows up in the top 10 results.</li>
     <li>Mac OS X actually seems to nurture an ecosystem of third-party developers who are simply brilliant in taking really simple, trivial software and totally re-thinking the way they should be written. I don't think this kinda polish is ever going to happen on Linux, because that last 20% bit requires a lot of effort which can only be justified if you're actually making money selling your work. With that kinda overall finish, I actually feel like opening my wallet and paying for even trivial software like CD burning or FTP clients for the first time.</li>
</ul>
