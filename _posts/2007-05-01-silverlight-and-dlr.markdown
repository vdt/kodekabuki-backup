<p>I wonder how Adobe feels after these two announcements from Microsoft (if they're not, they should be scared!).</p> 

<p>Miguel De Icaza has a <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-01.html">nice summary</a> of what's been happening at Mix 07 and also the implications of all this on the Mono project.</p>

<p>This is all good! We don't need Flash and AS anymore. Writing a RIA for the browser using my favorite language (C#, Python, Ruby or whatever else it might be) is just amazing. Only annoying thing though is that even though they have the SilverLight runtime for Mac OS X, the development tools are still Windows-only.</p>

<p>Apparently it turns out that the DLR has implications beyond just SilverLight. It means that now I could write a library in Python, and then you can go and write a Ruby script which makes use of my Python library as well as any other library written in other static .NET languages (C# or VB.NET). That's just sweet! Now this part should get Sun scared too :) Read more about this from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/archive/2007/04/30/a-dynamic-language-runtime-dlr.aspx">Jim Hugunin's blog</a>.</p>
