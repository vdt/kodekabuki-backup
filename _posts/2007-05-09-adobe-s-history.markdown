<p>I've just started reading <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/">Founders At Work</a> (the book is great if you love reading about Silicon Valley entrepreneurs). By far the most interesting chapter I've read until now (only finished reading half of the book) is the one on Adobe's co-founder, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Geschke">Charles Geschke</a>. Ok this might be because I kinda knew the story behind the other companies and their founders (Flickr, ViaWeb, Fog Creek, Delicious, Blake Ross/FF, Hotmail, Paypal, Six Apart, 37Signals, Pyra Labs and Apple) already.</p>

<p>A few things I learnt about Adobe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe was named after the Adobe Creek which flows right behind Charles Geschke's house in the Valley.</li>
<li>Both the founders developed a pre-cursor to PostScript at Xerox PARC. Xerox as usual rejected their idea, and the founders quit their jobs at Xerox to start Adobe.</li>
<li>Adobe initially made most of its money by licensing their PostScript interpreter to printer manufacturers.</li>
<li>Adobe also developed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserWriter">LaserWriter</a> for Apple. This was their first big contract. <br />
</li>
<li>Apple also bought around 20% of Adobe around the same time.</li>
<li>At some point, they realized that most apps which existed in the market didn't exploit the full potential of PostScript. That's when they started developing Illustrator and started selling it. Also, they thought it would be nice to have multiple sources of revenue instead of relying completely on PostScript.</li>
<li>At around the same time, Geschke met two guys who had this really cool photo-manipulation software. Adobe bought them immediately. Guess what it's called? Photoshop!</li>
</ul>
