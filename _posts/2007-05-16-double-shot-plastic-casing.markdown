MIT TechnologyReview has interesting articles on industrial design innovation in electronic products. First one is on <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Biztech/18621/page1/">Apple</a> (ya that's pretty obvious) and the second one is on <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18647/page1/">Helio</a>.<br />
<p/><blockquote><p>But Apple, Rolston says, "will change a whole factory's process."What's more, he adds, the company keeps its eyes open for newmanufacturing possibilities, no matter how obscure. <strong>One example is the"double-shot" method of combining layers of different ordifferent-colored materials</strong>. Apple "saw that a manufacturer had a special process for this on a small scale," Rolston says, andincorporated layered materials into its designs--for example, the clearplastic layered over colored materials in iPods and older iMacs."[Apple] pushed them to do it on a much larger scale. Apple helped themanufacturers master the process and product."</p>

</blockquote><p>I also noticed this "double-shot" thing sometime back when I bought a NintendoDS Lite. Apart from aesthetic purposes, does it serve any other purpose - more efficient manufacturing process?</p>
