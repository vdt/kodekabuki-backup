<p>A security professional from a company called Determina recently gave a talk on reverse engineering Microsoft patches to find security vulnerabilities at Google [<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7185841369679533904&amp;q=engedu">Google Video</a>]. He actually demoed an exploit in Windows Vista (has something to do with ANI file loading library which gets used by both IE and Firefox and other browsers).</p>

<p>But what is more interesting is his last slide where he compares the implementation (or the lack) of security mechanisms in all the latest desktop OSes. Mac OS X seems to lack a lot of new stuff which Microsoft introduced in Vista. But one has to remember though that these are just mechanisms to protect against exploits and is not indicative of the quality of the codebase itself. If your codebase is of bad quality to begin with, you're going to have a lot more exploits and having a lot of cool new security mechanisms may not do the job. Still sad to see how Apple is lacking in terms of security (even though they would like to smirk at Microsoft in those PC vs. Mac ads).<br />
