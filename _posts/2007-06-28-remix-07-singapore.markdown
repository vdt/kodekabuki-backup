<p>I was in Orchard today for my <a href="http://www.pixelmetrix.com">company</a>'s distributor meet at the Phoenix Hotel. So I decided to drop by <a href="http://geekterminal.com/">Geek Terminal</a> for Microsoft's Pre-<a href="http://www.visitremix.com.sg/">Remix '07</a> event instead of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/singapore-rb">Ruby Brigade</a>'s meetup which was being held at Aljunied. Also I wanted to meet <a href="http://leebrimelow.com/blog/">Lee Brimelow</a> from <a href="http://www.frogdesign.com/">Frog Design</a> mostly because I've heard a lot about Frog Design. </p>

<p>Anyways had a nice chat with Lee. Apparently he was responsible for building the new WPF version of <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/windowsvista.php">Yahoo! Messenger</a> (yet to be released). Also met Beau Amber. I honestly didn't really know who this guy was until he showed <a href="http://www.metaliq.com/portfolio/silverlight.html">Top Banana</a> and it all came back to me. His company <a href="http://www.metaliq.com/">Metaliq</a> is like the poster-child for Silverlight. He has been sorta evangelising Silverlight through out the world.<br />
