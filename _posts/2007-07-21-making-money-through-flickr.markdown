I realized my friend <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arpanroy/">Arpan</a> has really transformed into a kick-ass photographer. I remember exactly one year ago when we went to Sim Lim to buy a camera and he ended up buying a Fujifilm FinePix S5600 for S$700. He was such an amateur back then. Last week he told me Singapore Airlines bought the rights to publish some of his pics on Flickr in their in-flight magazine KrisFlyer.

I just wish he would travel more. He would run out of good places to shoot pics in Singapore soon.
