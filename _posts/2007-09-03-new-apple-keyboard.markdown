<p>I just got myself a brand new <a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/">Apple Keyboard</a> (wired version). It feels just like the MacBook keyboard. If you're not a big fan of the MacBook keyboard, you should seriously consider not buying this one. </p>

<p>I decided to buy the Apple keyboard because it has an in-built USB hub (2 ports). Now I can use 4 USB ports all together (2 from the MacBook and 2 from the keyboard). But remember that devices which need a lot of power won't work if you hook them up to the ports in the keyboard unless if you're using the keyboard with the latest iMac (this is straight out of the horse's mouth).</p>

<p>Btw once you have plugged in the keyboard to your Mac, do yourself a favor by <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/2005/key-bindings-for-switchers/">rebinding the Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys</a> to non-default actions to achieve Windows-like behavior. This is the whole reason I got myself a full-size keyboard in the first place! </p>
