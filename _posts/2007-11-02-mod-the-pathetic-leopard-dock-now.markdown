<p>Apple has made some really horrible mistakes in Leopard with the most prominent OS X UI elements - the menu bar looks ridiculous with the transparency, and in the case of the Dock you cannot clearly see those glowing dots which are supposed to represent running apps. If anyone spent even 5 seconds with Leopard, they would have realized these problems immediately!</p>

<p>Fortunately, it is very easy to fix the dock. You just have to open up the Dock package, and replace the PNGs which are being used for the Dock with new (better looking) ones like <a href="http://www.insidemacgames.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=31923">these</a>.</p>
