<p>Watching this video is the most fun I have ever had with Java. The two brothers who gave this talk at Google are also the authors of a book called "Java Puzzlers". Basically it is a book full of Java puzzles - not your run-of-the-mill Java interview kinda questions! These are really interesting puzzles (some of them actually illustrate poor implementation of some methods/classes in the Java API and how they violate "<i>the principle of least surprise</i>"). I just got my hands on their book. Will post more as I read the book.

It's fun to read about Java for a change now that I program in Python+Javascript full-time at work.
