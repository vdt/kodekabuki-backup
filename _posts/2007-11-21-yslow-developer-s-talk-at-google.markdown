What's really interesting is the way he defines the term "front-end" in his talk - performance optimization of the front-end (according to him) does not just include Javascript code optimization but literally includes optimizing everything that a browser needs to do after the initial HTML page download in order to completely render the page. In other words, he includes everything that YSlow measures as part of front-end performance metrics.
