<p>I got myself an iPhone on the last day of my trip to San Francisco. It's the best phone I've ever owned (the Treo 600 doesn't come close to it)! My favorite part of it is when I read my news feeds via the Google Reader iPhone app while I'm on the bus/MRT. Saves me atleast 20 mins!</p>

<p>Buying the iPhone though turned out to be a bit of a hassle. First we went to an Apple Store in San Mateo, and the guy asked me if I would be using it outside the States and I replied "yes" (I'm terrible at lying). And then he refused to sell me the iPhone and asked me to try my luck at a different store. Then we went to the Stanford Apple Store. This time the guy asked me for an American credit card (they won't take cash), and some American ID. So effectively there's no way you can buy an iPhone if you're a foreigner (at least in the Bay Area). And finally thanks to my colleague Mario who bought one for me. </p>
