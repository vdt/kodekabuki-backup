<p>Today something happened which made the whole upgrade to Leopard worthwhile. I tried to edit some system files (property list files) and I guess I messed up and my MacBook won't boot anymore. But I had a TimeMachine backup from the previous hour :-)</p>

<p>So I pop-in my Leopard DVD; hold down 'C' to boot from the Combo drive; pick "Restore from TimeMachine" option under the "Utilities" menu in the Leopard Installer; choose my TimeMachine partition from the external drive. And exactly 59 mins later (which I spent reading the Erlang book), I'm typing this blog entry like nothing ever happened. Love it! This is great software.</p>

<p>One calamity though is I lost my Parallels Windows XP disk. I excluded it from my TimeMachine backup folder list because of the amount of space TimeMachine would waste in storing (and tracking changes) to the big virtual disk file.</p>
