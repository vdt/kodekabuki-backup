<p>Hearing the words pluggable plastic modules, Java and RESTified APIs just makes my heart go fast! Ship them soon will ya? :-) Something like this would be more useful than an Arduino board or an OpenMoko phone to hack on because you get an extensible hardware platform and not a one-purpose device. Also I'm hoping their prices would be reasonable - the base around US$ 300 and each extensible module for roughly US$ 50? To me this would be the right price.</p>

<p>I just hope they'll reach critical mass. Once they do, they're going to be immensely popular because success here is heavily dependent on the community.</p>
