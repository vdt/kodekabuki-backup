<p>I was reading an article titled <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/19529/">The Blow-Up</a> (requires paid subscription) from MIT Technology Review's Dec issue. The article is about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analyst">Quants</a> might have been the reason for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Subprime_mortgage_financial_crisis">recent sub-prime crisis</a> in the financial markets.</p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from that article which summarizes the reason for the sub-prime crisis:<br/>

<p>Apparently what made it worse was most of these quants at different funds were using pretty much the same strategies/algorithms and hence they all tried to buy & sell the same stocks at the same time. Also note that most of this trading was triggered by computers.</p>

<p>On a sidenote, I think next to Computer Science, Wall St has the best jargon possible :-)</p>
