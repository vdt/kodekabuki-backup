If you watched Jobs' keynote from yesterday, he showcased the ad for the Macbook Air. If you missed it, go watch it on the Apple website. The song played in the ad is called "New Soul" by Yael Naim, a Paris-born Israeli (which would explain the accent) and the album was apparently made in a studio in her apartment.
