<p>I was just reading a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/30/stanford-computer-science-grads-getting-95k-offers-from-google/">Techcrunch article</a> on starting salaries for CS grads in the Valley (you've to normalize for top schools <-> best companies to make any sense of this data). Avg pay seems to be around $50-70k and best students seem to get upto $90-100k. But based on one comment, investment banks still seem to be paying a lot more than the likes of Google, Facebook or Yahoo. Interestingly Yahoo pays more than the rest in the Valley.</p>

I kinda knew this already but what it would be interesting to know how much students from Tier 2 CS schools get paid? Also how are salaries in other parts of the country for fresh CS grads (Seattle/Kirkland, Chicago, Boston, NY)? I'm guessing most of the top CS students on the East Coast probably tend to work for Wall St.
