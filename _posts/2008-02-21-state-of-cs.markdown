It is a real problem in my opinion. I have been long enough in this game to have realised an unfortunate truth. Namely, that Computer Science fundamentals are re-learned by each new generation in the field. The "science" doesn't seem to move on much in a formal sense. Instead, stories are handed down in an ad-hoc fashion from generation to generation around digital campfires.

<p>Well said...(not that I'm an authority in the field to claim so; but somehow I get the feeling that people are  re-discovering all the gems invented in the 60s).</p>
