I just wasted around 20 mins because I enabled Freehanded editing by mistake (via the keyboard shortcut) and I didn't know it existed. Once you enable Freehanded editing in TextMate, it will let you move the cursor inside of Tab characters (tab here can be actual tab or a soft tab). And this can be annoying because now you're not navigating as fast as you normally do because you're not skipping over those tab-spaces. 

So remember to keep this disabled (Edit->Mode->Freehanded editing). I don't really know when this mode would be useful?
