I just updated my iPhone's firmware to 1.1.4 using the new [Pwnage](http://iphone-dev.org/) tool. It was previously running 1.1.1 (cracked using anySIM unlock and jailbreakme.com jailbreak).

If you would like to do the same, I would recommend the links below. 

*  [iClarified's tutorial](http://www.iclarified.com/entry/comments.php?page=2&enid=893)
*  NOR flashing failed error - if you already have a firmware which has been unlocked and jailbroken via some other methods, then you need to first restore the "pure" Apple firmware before attempting to use Pwnage. [Read more...](http://broo2.blogspot.com/2008/04/iphone-pwnage-tool.html). This is the only hiccup I encountered during the whole update process. 
*  Watch [Engadget's video](http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/03/video-the-iphone-dev-teams-pwnage-tool-in-action/) which walks you through the entire process.
*  Remember to backup your data using iTunes - this way you can just restore the backed-up info after updating to the new custom firmware.

Now that I've done this and it works great, I want to try the 1.2 / 2.0 (beta) firmware. Anyone knows how I can get my hands on one? Searching in ThePirateBay didn't help.
