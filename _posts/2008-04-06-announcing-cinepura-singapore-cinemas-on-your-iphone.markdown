I scratched a long time itch and built a simple iPhone app which fetches the list of movies currently playing in Singapore cinemas. And more importantly it displays the IMDb ratings for these movies - my friends and I swear by IMDb ratings. Tomatometer just doesn't cut it! Showtimes are fetched from Yahoo! Movies Singapore.

I'm calling the app [Cinepura](http://poundbang.in/cinepura/). Go play with it! It's actually useful even on a desktop browser.

Next in line is a restaurants app and I'm probably going to use [HungryGoWhere.com](http://www.hungrygowhere.com) as my datasource. Do you have any other suggestions?
