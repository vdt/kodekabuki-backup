This is one issue which really gets me worked up. Why is it so hard for genuinely talented people to get H1Bs while real dumb-fucks from major service companies make their way through so easily? 3 major Indian IT services companies apparently take up more than 70-80% of H1B quota. Looking at that post, it seems like this is a global problem. Whether you're British, Brazilian or Czech, you've to go through the same shit.

My dad's startup has recently raised VC funding from the US and they're planning to shift operations to the US very soon. And immigration is a huge problem.
