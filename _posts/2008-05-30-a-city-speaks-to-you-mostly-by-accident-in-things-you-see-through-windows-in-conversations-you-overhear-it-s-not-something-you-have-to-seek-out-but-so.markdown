> A city speaks to you mostly by accidentâ€”in things you see through windows, in conversations you overhear. It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off.

Another trademark PG essay! So what does Singapore say to you? "*Copy the West as blindly as you can and do it better than the rest of SE Asia*". Don't get me wrong but this is what I feel after staying here for 5 years.

Whatever PG says in the article makes a lot of sense. My parents moved from Bangalore to Hyderabad recently, and the two cities send completely different messages to you. They hate Hyderabad (and the ironical part is we're Telugu).
