Git then shows you hunks of the diff between HEAD and your working copy. For each hunk, you can choose whether or not you want to stage the hunk. For large hunks, Git will also offer to split the hunk into smaller hunks which you can stage independently. (There are other options, such as options to stage or unstage all remaining hunks.)
