This is amazing stuff. I observed a lot of this during my short stint at my previous company. They build network intelligence systems for TV broadcast networks. Each unit (depending on the model) was roughly priced between $7k-$50k. 

What they were doing was not rocket science. They designed a board, slapped on a FPGA + couple of PPC processors. Then get Linux running on the board. Read through the protocol specs and implement them. And finally throw a HTML/Qt GUI on top of the stats to help people visualize better.

I think a lot of people are capable of building this given enough time. The biggest problem is until I joined this company and attended a couple of huge trade shows, I didn't know that there's a huge business for software like this! More than anything else, I was simply blown away by just this fact when I started working there.
