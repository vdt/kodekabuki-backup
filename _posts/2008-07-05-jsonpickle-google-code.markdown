jsonpickle allows for any Python object to be serialized into JSON. This library acts as an extension to simplejson. Whereas simplejson only serializes primitive objects (str, int, float, list, dict, etc), jsonpickle can handle most non-builtin Python objects. jsonpickle recursively examines Python objects and collections (dictionaries, lists, tuples, and sets), and converts non primitive objects to a primitive version.
