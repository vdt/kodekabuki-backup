> Nielsen's layoffs also drew attention from CNN's Lou Dobbs, who has railed against the H-1B program. India offshore providers are major users of the H-1B visa, with Tata getting 797 of the visas in 2007. Opponents cite the visa's use in outsourcing to counter tech industry claims by Bill Gates and others that the visa is used to hire "the best and the brightest" foreign graduates of U.S. universities. Congress is currently struggling to find a middle ground through legislative efforts to give a Green Card, or permanent residency, to foreign nationals who receive advanced degrees from U.S. universities.

When you made your process for selecting applicants a lottery, what else did you expect? They should seriously stop giving so many visas to these few big Indian outsourcing giants when they know clearly that these companies have been abusing the system for years now by just applying in volumes to increase their odds in the lottery.
