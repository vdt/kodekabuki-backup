> Once we’ve got a candidate list of dates, we take a look at your traveller network to see if anyone who shares trips with you is going to the same place. If so, and the dates of their trips are similar to yours (within 24 hours or so) then we bump that date suggestion way up the list. If you and your friends or colleagues are going on the same holiday, conference trip or work visit, this works very effectively.
