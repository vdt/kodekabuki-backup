<a href="http://www.lindsayresnick.com/Radical_Innovation.pdf">Hot causes and cool mobilization</a>

The article (PDF) is a condensed version of the ideas in Hayagreeva Rao's book, [Market Rebels](http://www.amazon.com/Market-Rebels-Activists-Radical-Innovations/dp/0691134561). I didn't know the origins of the use of the word "cool" to mean hip/different are from the world of jazz.
