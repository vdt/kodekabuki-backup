Economist writes about the interesting business model of [Virgance](http://www.virgance.com) (One of the [Powerset](http://www.powerset.com) founders' next venture). I don't know if pure online activism is good enough to fetch any results (but then again it's very cheap to do it online). They seem to draw parallels from Obama's successful online campaign efforts but they were just supplementary to more grassroots offline campaigns weren't they? At least I wouldn't mind seeing a day when there's a popular Facebook app which doesn't involve throwing sheep at someone.
