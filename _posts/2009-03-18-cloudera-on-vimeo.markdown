[Cloudera](http://www.cloudera.com) has been uploading their Hadoop training lectures to Vimeo. These lectures are great - they're actually recordings of some workshop they seem to have conducted. So you can actually walk-through the various steps on your PC while watching the lectures and learn by playing. 

If you're already familiar with Hadoop like me, then you should probably just go straight to watching the lecture on Facebook's Hive. Hive is similar to Pig but seems more mature. I didn't realize Hive was Opensource until now. This is something I need to play with soon.
