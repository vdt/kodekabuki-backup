> We even tried to do the “Hypertext as engine of application state” thing. To use the API, you need one URI to get started; it identifies the whole cloud. Dereference that, you get some JSON that has URIs for your VDCs; dereference those, and you get more JSON that represents your clusters and servers and networks and so on. This has the nice side-effect that the API doesn’t constrain the design of the URI space at all.

Tim Bray writes about the RESTful API they're planning for Sun's cloud service which will apparently be launched sometime later this year. Looks very RESTful indeed. For more background on what he means by "hypertext as engine of application state", read my [previous blog article](http://blog.poundbang.in/post/83751659/why-is-rest-named-so-cryptically) on RESTful APIs.
