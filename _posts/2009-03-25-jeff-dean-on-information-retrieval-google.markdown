Jeff Dean talks about information retrieval at WSDM'09. This talk is full of new content (this is not a talk about PageRank, or GFS/MapReduce). You can see a common trend - Google has lots of data stored in-memory now (actually they started doing this back in 2002 apparently). It seems like index shards (and their replicas) have 100% of their data in-memory at this point.
