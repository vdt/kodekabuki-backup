<a href="http://mallipeddi.github.com/uncloud/">Releasing Uncloud-0.1 - get off the cloud!</a>

Uncloud is a simple OS X utility to backup & archive GMail Folders. This is my first PyObjC app (or for that matter my first Cocoa application). It's no way fail-safe or feature-complete. Use it at your own risk! That said I've used it to backup folders/labels from my GMail account containing around 200+ emails with multiple attachments and it seems to work fine. Importing the archive files into Apple-Mail is straight-forward.
