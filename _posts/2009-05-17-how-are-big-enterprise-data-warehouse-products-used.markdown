<a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/papers/madskills-032009.pdf">How are big, enterprise data warehouse products used?</a>

The paper [pdf] documents the kinds of things that are possible with expensive data warehouse products like GreenPlum including how they've integrated map-reduce (specifically how it's being used at Fox Interactive Media). Warning: the paper sounds more like a GreenPlum whitepaper than UC Berkeley CS research.
