> In the application, at mps-expenses.guardian.co.uk, each MP's expenses and claims are presented as a set of images, and users can determine - and detail - what entries there are on a page, and decide whether the page is unimportant, interesting, "interesting but known" - such as a duck island - or worthy of investigation.
