A brilliant account of all the crap that Goldman Sachs has managed to pull off and get away with right from the beginning. The author argues that Goldman Sachs has been behind every major bubble in the USA right from the 1800s. 

And what's even worse is they're still actively doing the same, and will do so in the future with no one to stop them. Just makes me sad and angry and I'm not even an American (that probably won't make much of a difference in this flat new world - I bleed if America bleeds).

Must read (Thanks to [Deepak](http://antrix.net) for the link)
