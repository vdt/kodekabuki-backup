<a href="http://java.ociweb.com/mark/stm/article.html">In-depth look at Clojure's STM implementation</a>

Insightful article. I read most of the Clojure book last weekend and it has been lot of fun. This will be my first proper attempt at learning a Lisp (I ditched CommonLISP for Python in the AI class back in school). I'm using Clojure to write simple Hadoop jobs (turns out Hadoop is the only use-case currently where I rely on the JVM runtime).
