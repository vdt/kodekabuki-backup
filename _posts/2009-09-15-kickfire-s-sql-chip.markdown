Daniel Abadi blogs about how Kickfire achieves parallelism in their FPGA-based SQL chip. Also watch Kickfire CEO, [Raj Cherabuddi's talk](http://blip.tv/file/981371) at MySQLConf 2008. 

Btw if you're interested in next-gen DBMSes, subscribing to Daniel Abadi is highly recommended; he's a member of the Yale DB group which released HadoopDB.
