There were a couple of interesting articles on DBMS2 on log analysis software vendors, [Splunk](http://www.dbms2.com/2009/10/18/general-introduction-to-splunk/) and [SenSage](http://www.dbms2.com/2009/10/18/introduction-to-sensage/). I'm amazed that both companies have around 150+ employees and are profitable. There's also a good summary of who their main customers are and how they're using their products.
