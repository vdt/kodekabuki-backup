Informative talk by Ashish Thusoo and Namit Jain from Facebook's Hive team.

Hive's [RCFile](http://hadoop.apache.org/hive/docs/r0.4.0/api/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/RCFile.html) is pretty interesting - it provides record-columnar storage on top of HDFS. Apparently it results in [very good compression](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/24403843/DataTeam-Presentation_2009-12-11_-V02) and higher scan throughput.
