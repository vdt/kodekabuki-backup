I attended [RubyConf India 2010](rubyconfindia.org/) last weekend. I haven't done Ruby much so far (Python is my de facto language). But this was a lot of fun nevertheless.

The conference was organized by ThoughtWorks and the speakers list was more or less dominated by ThoughtWorkers (both from India and Overseas). The general impression I got by interacting with the attendees is that most of the big companies in India (both MNCs and IT majors) don't really do Ruby/Rails. The only companies which are using Ruby are small Indian web startups and since there are not any big Indian web success stories so far, there aren't really any Indian shops using Ruby/Rails at a big scale. Still it was a great conference - kudos to ThoughtWorks for making it happen.

[Matz](http://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz) joined in via a video call from Japan to talk about the future of Ruby. He foresees Ruby being more functional in the future and being more explicit vs implicit (ring a bell? that sounds a lot like Python's design goal? :).

[@Obie](http://twitter.com/obie)'s talk was mostly about how HashRocket works and the content was more or less the same as from his previous talks at other international Ruby/Rails conferences. Apparently HashRocket has a full-time videographer on their payroll continuously shooting video as the devs are working, having fun, whatever-else that is they do at HashRocket. A lot of importance is given to work culture, jealously guarding their principles (even if that means saying "no" to a potential client), having fun. There don't rely on traditional job interviews - they invite candidates to work for them for a week on a trial basis - candidates are expected to pair-program with the employees.
