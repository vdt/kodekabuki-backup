> when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.




Just saw this tweet by _why in a [RailsConf '10 talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8ZQwz76wuM) by Neal Ford. It's been two months since I've started doing full-time Ruby development (at [ZumoDrive](http://www.zumodrive.com)). I've seen some beautiful code, I've cursed meta-programming (someone overrided something inside a gem somewhere and it blew up somewhere else), but most of all I've been impressed by how the Ruby community always strives to create beautiful new things. 

There are entire talks in Ruby conferences devoted to encouraging people to *create*, to *design* great APIs, to strive for better. These ideals make it seem like they really want to be more of an artist than an engineer.
