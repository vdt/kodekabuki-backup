<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_amplification">Wikipedia - Write amplification & TRIM command on SSDs</a>

Also good reads: benchmarking SSD performance on [Windows 7](http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/storage/2010/02/04/windows-7-ssd-performance-and-trim/1) and [OS X](http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/apple/2010/07/01/mac-ssd-performance-trim-in-osx/1) with and without TRIM. 

Earlier versions of Windows (pre-Windows 7) don't have TRIM support apparently. The article doesn't seem to have a good explanation for why performance in OS X doesn't degrade due to write amplification even though TRIM hasn't been set (at least according to the System Profiler app in OS X).
