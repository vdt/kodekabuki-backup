> The goal of Anonymouse is to selectively exclude data from the cookies we drop so that our users are sufficiently indistinguishable. We define “sufficiently indistinguishable” using the notion of k-anonymity. A dataset is k-anonymous as long as every record in the set is identical to no fewer than k-1 other records.

The article describes how Rapleaf is trying to automate the process of anonymizing user data (from cookies). Read the [follow-up post](http://blog.rapleaf.com/dev/2010/08/11/very-fast-batch-superset-queries/) in which they describe how they sped-up 'superset queries' (get all supersets containing the given set) to implement anonymouse.
