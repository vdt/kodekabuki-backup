Yossi Kreinin writes about his experiences with the Forth programming language and concludes that he wasn't able to ever scale Forth to solve a real-life problem. I tried to teach myself Factor, a Forth-inspired modern stack language. I quickly came to the same conclusion. The simplicity of implementing a naive interpreter for a stack language was very exciting but unlike when I learnt Erlang, there was no sudden excitement about how I could use this new language to build a whole bunch of cool things.
