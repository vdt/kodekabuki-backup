Foursquare Ops publish a post mortem of their recent outage on their blog. The post made by MongoDB engineer in the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user/browse_thread/thread/528a94f287e9d77e?pli=1) is actually more interesting since it reveals more of the technical details, and what went wrong specifically because of MongoDB's behavior.
